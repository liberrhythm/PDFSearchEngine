Abstract
An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse
prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in e.g. neural
language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting
the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector
from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive
O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D × d output
weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous
layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case
of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations
during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which,
for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax,
can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d2 ) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably
without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields

a speedup of 4d
, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part
of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network
architecture.

Introduction

Many modern applications of neural networks have to deal with data represented, or representable,
as very large sparse vectors. Such representations arise in natural language related tasks, where
the dimension D of that vector is typically (a multiple of) the size of the vocabulary, and also in
the sparse user-item matrices of collaborative-filtering applications. It is trivial to handle very large
sparse inputs to a neural network in a computationally efficient manner: the forward propagation
and update to the input weight matrix after backpropagation are correspondingly sparse. By contrast, training with very large sparse prediction targets is problematic: even if the target is sparse, the
computation of the equally large network output and the corresponding gradient update to the huge
output weight matrix are not sparse and thus computationally prohibitive. This has been a practical
problem ever since Bengio et al. [1] first proposed using a neural network for learning a language
model, in which case the computed output vector represents the probability of the next word and
is the size of the considered vocabulary, which is becoming increasingly large in modern applications [2]. Several approaches have been proposed to attempt to address this difficulty essentially by
sidestepping it. They fall in two categories:
• Sampling or selection based approximations consider and compute only a tiny fraction of the
output’s dimensions sampled at random or heuristically chosen. The reconstruction sampling of
Dauphin et al. [3], the efficient use of biased importance sampling in Jean et al. [4], the use of

Noise Contrastive Estimation [5] in Mnih and Kavukcuoglu [6] and Mikolov et al. [7] all fall
under this category. As does the more recent use of approximate Maximum Inner Product Search
based on Locality Sensitive Hashing techniques[8, 9] to select a good candidate subset.
• Hierarchical softmax [10, 7] imposes a heuristically defined hierarchical tree structure for the
computation of the normalized probability of the target class.
Compared to the initial problem of considering all D output dimensions, both kinds of approaches
are crude approximations. In the present work, we will instead investigate a way to actually perform
the exact gradient update that corresponds to considering all D outputs, but do so implicitly, in a
computationally efficient manner, without actually computing the D outputs. This approach works
for a relatively restricted class of loss functions, the simplest of which is linear output with squared
error (a natural choice for sparse real-valued regression targets). The most common choice for
multiclass classification, the softmax loss is not part of that family, but we may use an alternative
spherical softmax, which will also yield normalized class probabilities. For simplicity and clarity,
our presentation will focus on squared error and on an online setting. We will briefly discuss its
extension to minibatches and to the class of possible loss functions in sections 3.5 and 3.6.

The problem
Problem definition and setup

We are concerned with gradient-descent based training of a deep feed-forward neural network with
target vectors of very high dimension D (e.g. D = 200 000) but that are sparse, i.e. a comparatively
small number, at most K  D, of the elements of the target vector are non-zero. Such a Ksparse vector will typically be stored and represented compactly as 2K numbers corresponding
to pairs (index, value). A network to be trained with such targets will naturally have an equally
large output layer of dimension D. We can also optionally allow the input to the network to be a
similarly high dimensional sparse vector of dimension Din . Between the large sparse target, output,
and (optionally large sparse) input, we suppose the network’s intermediate hidden layers to be of
smaller, more typically manageable, dimension d  D (e.g. d = 500)1 .
Mathematical notation: Vectors are denoted using lower-case letters, e.g. h, and are considered
column-vectors; corresponding row vectors are denoted with a transpose, e.g. hT . Matrices are
denoted using upper-case letters, e.g. W , with W T the transpose of W . The ith column of W is
T
denoted Wi , and its ith row W:i (both viewed as a column vector). U −T = U −1 denotes the
transpose of the inverse of a square matrix. Id is the d × d identity matrix.

Network architecture: We consider a standard feed forward neural network architecture as depicted in Figure 1. An input vector x ∈ RDin is linearly transformed into a linear activation
a(1) = W (1)T x + b(1) through a Din × d input weight matrix W (1) (and an optional bias vector
b(1) ∈ Rd ). This is typically followed by a non-linear transformation s to yield the representation of
the first hidden layer h(1) = s(a(1) ). This first hidden layer representation is then similarly transformed through a number of subsequent non-linear layers (that can be of any usual kind amenable to
backpropagation) e.g. h(k) = s(a(k) ) with a(k) = W (k)T h(k−1) + b(k) until we obtain last hidden
layer representation h = h(m) . We then obtain the final D-dimensional network output as o = W h
where W is a D × d output weight matrix, which will be our main focus in this work. Finally, the
network’s D-dimensional output o is compared to the D-dimensional target vector y associated with
input x using squared error, yielding loss L = ko − yk2 .

Training procedure: This architecture is a typical (possibly deep) multi-layer feed forward neural
network architecture with a linear output layer and squared error loss. Its parameters (weight matrices and bias vectors) will be trained by gradient descent, using gradient backpropagation [11, 12, 13]
to efficiently compute the gradients. The procedure is shown in Figure 1. Given an example from
the training set as an (input,target) pair (x, y), a pass of forward propagation proceeds as outlined above, computing the hidden representation of each hidden layer in turn based on the previous one, and finally the network’s predicted output o and associated loss L. A pass of gradient
backpropagation then works in the opposite direction, starting from ∇o = ∂L
∂o = 2(o − y) and

1
Our approach does not impose any restriction on the architecture nor size of the hidden layers, as long as
they are amenable to usual gradient backpropagation.

for the output layer which will be our main focus here: W ← W − η∇W .
2.2

The easy part: input layer forward propagation and weight update

It is easy and straightforward to efficiently compute the forward propagation, and the backpropagation and weight update part for the input layer when we have a very large Din -dimensional but
K−sparse input vector x with appropriate sparse representation. Specifically we suppose that x is
represented as a pair of vectors u, v of length (at most) K, where u contains integer indexes and v
the associated real values of the elements of x such that xi = 0 if i ∈
/ u, and xuk = vk .

• Forward propagation through the input layer: The sparse representation of x as the positions
of K elements together with their value makes it cheap to compute W (1)T x. Even though W (1)
may be a huge full Din × d matrix, only K of its rows (those corresponding to the non-zero
entries of x) need to be visited and summed to compute W (1)T x. Precisely, with our (u, v) sparse
PK
(1)
(1)
representation of x this operation can be written as W (1)T x = k=1 vk W:uk where each W:uk
is a d-dimensional vector, making this an O(Kd) operation rather than O(Dd).
• Gradient and update through input layer: Let us for now suppose that we were able to get
gradients (through backpropagation) up to the first hidden layer activations a(1) ∈ Rd in the form
of gradient vector ∇a(1) = ∂a∂L
(1) . The corresponding gradient-based update to input layer weights
W (1) is simply W (1) ← W (1) − ηx(∇a(1) )T . This is a rank-one update to W (1) . Here again, we
see that only the K rows of W (1) associated to the (at most) K non-zero entries of x need to be
(1)
(1)
modified. Precisely this operation can be written as: W:uk ← W:uk −ηvk ∇a(1) ∀k ∈ {1, . . . , K}
making this again a O(Kd) operation rather than O(Dd).

The hard part: output layer propagation and weight update

Given some network input x, we suppose we can compute without difficulty through forward propagation the associated last hidden layer representation h ∈ Rd . From then on:

• Computing the final output o = W h incurs a prohibitive computational cost of O(Dd) since W
is a full D × d matrix. Note that there is a-priori no reason for representation h to be sparse (e.g.
with a sigmoid non-linearity) but even if it was, this would not fundamentally change the problem
since it is D that is extremely large, and we supposed d reasonably sized already. Computing the
residual (o − y) and associated squared error loss ko − yk2 incurs an additional O(D) cost.
T
• The gradient on h that we need to backpropagate to lower layers is ∇h = ∂L
∂h = 2W (o − y)
which is another O(Dd) matrix-vector product.
• Finally, when performing the corresponding output weight update W ← W − η(o − y)hT we see
that it is a rank-one update that updates all D × d elements of W , which again incurs a prohibitive
O(Dd) computational cost.

For very large D, all these three O(Dd) operations are prohibitive, and the fact that y is sparse, seen
from this perspective, doesn’t help, since neither o nor o − y will be sparse.

3

A computationally efficient algorithm for performing the exact online
gradient update

Previously proposed workarounds are approximate or use stochastic sampling. We propose a different approach that results in the exact same, yet efficient gradient update, remarkably without ever
having to compute large output o.
3.1

Computing the squared error loss L and the gradient with respect to h efficiently

Suppose that, we have, for a network input example x, computed the last hidden representation
h ∈ Rd through forward propagation. The network’s D dimensional output o = W h is then in
principle compared to the high dimensional target y ∈ RD . The corresponding squared error loss
2
is L = kW h − yk . As we saw in Section 2.3, computing it in the direct naive way would have
a prohibitive computational complexity of O(Dd + D) = O(Dd) because computing output W h
with a full D × d matrix W and a typically non-sparse h is O(Dd). Similarly, to backpropagate
the gradient through the network, we need to compute the gradient of loss L with respect to last
∂kW h−yk2
hidden layer representation h. This is ∇h = ∂L
= 2W T (W h − y). So again, if
∂h =
∂h
we were to compute it directly in this manner, the computational complexity would be a prohibitive
O(Dd). Provided we have maintained an up-to-date matrix Q = W T W , which is of reasonable
size d × d and can be cheaply maintained as we will see in Section 3.3, we can rewrite these two
operations so as to perform them in O(d2 ):

Efficient gradient update of W

The gradient of the squared error loss with respect to output layer weight matrix W is

= 2(W h − y)h . And the corresponding gradient descent update to W would be
Wnew ← W − 2η(W h − y)hT , where η is a positive learning rate. Again, computed in this manner,
this induces a prohibitive O(Dd) computational complexity, both to compute output and residual
W h − y, and then to update all the Dd elements of W (since generally neither W h − y nor h will
be sparse). All D × d elements of W must be accessed during this update. On the surface this seems
hopeless. But we will now see how we can achieve the exact same update on W in O(d2 ). The trick
is to represent W implicitly as the factorization |{z}
W = |{z}

= W − 2η(W h − y)T hT

We see that the update of U in Eq. 3 is a simple O(d2 ) operation. Following this simple rank-one
update to U , we can use the Sherman-Morrison formula to derive the corresponding rank-one update
to U −T which will also be O(d2 ):

update of V in Eq 4, thanks to the K-sparsity of y is only O(Kd): only the K rows V associated
to non-zero elements in y are accessed and updated, instead of all D rows of W we had to modify
in the naive update! Note that with the factored representation of W as V U , we only have W
implicitly, so the W T y terms that entered in the computation of L and ∇h in the previous paragraph
need to be adapted slightly as ŷ = W T y = U T (V T y), which becomes O(d2 + Kd) rather than
O(Kd) in computational complexity. But this doesn’t change the overall O(d2 ) complexity of these
computations.

3.3

Bookkeeping: keeping an up-to-date Q and U −T

We have already seen, in Eq. 5, how we can cheaply maintain an up-to-date U −T following our
update of U . Similarly, following our updates to U and V , we need to keep an up-to-date Q =
W T W which is needed to efficiently compute the loss L (Eq. 1) and gradient ∇h (Eq. 2). We have
shown that updates to U and V in equations 3 and 4 are equivalent to implicitly updating W as
Wnew ← W − 2η(W h − y)hT , and this translates into the following update to Q = W T W :

The proof is straightforward but due to space constraints we put it in supplementary material. One
can see that this last bookkeeping operation also has a O(d2 ) computational complexity.

3.4

Putting it all together: detailed algorithm and expected benefits

We have seen that we can efficiently compute cost L, gradient with respect to h (to be later backpropagated further) as well as updating U and V and performing the bookkeeping for U −T and
Q. Algorithm 1 describes the detailed algorithmic steps that we put together from the equations
derived above. Having K  d  D we see that the proposed algorithm requires O(d2 ) operations,
whereas the standard approach required O(Dd) operations. If we take K ≈ d , we may state more
precisely that the proposed algorithm, for computing the loss and the gradient updates will require
roughly 12d2 operations whereas the standard approach required roughly 3Dd operations. So overD
all the proposed algorithm change corresponds to a computational speedup by a factor of 4d
. For
D = 200 000 and d = 500 the expected speedup is thus 100. Note that the advantage is not only
in computational complexity, but also in memory access. For each example, the standard approach
needs to access and change all D × d elements of matrix W , whereas the proposed approach only
accesses the much smaller number K × d elements of V as well as the three d × d matrices U , U −T ,
and Q. So overall we have a substantially faster algorithm, which, while doing so implicitly, will
nevertheless perform the exact same gradient update as the standard approach. We want to emphasize here that our approach is completely different from simply chaining 2 linear layers U and V
and performing ordinary gradient descent updates on them: this would result in the same prohibitive
computational complexity as the standard approach, and such ordinary separate gradient updates to
U and V would not be equivalent to the ordinary gradient update to W = V U .

Controlling numerical stability and extension to the minibatch case

The update of U in Equation 3 may over time lead U to become ill-conditioned. To prevent this,
we regularly (every 100 updates) monitor its conditioning number. If either the smallest or largest
singular value moves outside an acceptable range2 , we bring it back to 1 by doing an appropriate
rank-1 update to V (which costs Dd operations, but is only done rarely). Our algorithm can also
be straightforwardly extended to the minibatch case (the derivations are given in the supplementary material section) and yields the same theoretical speedup factor with respect to the standard
naive approach. But one needs to be careful in order to keep the computation of U −T h reasonably
efficient: depending on the size of the minibatch m, it may be more efficient to solve the corresponding linear equation for each minibatch from scratch rather than updating U −T with the Woodbury
equation (which generalizes the Sherman-Morrison formula for m > 1).

Generalization to a broader class of loss functions

The approach that we just detailed for linear output and squared error can be extended to a broader,
though restricted, family of loss functions. We call it the spherical family of loss functions because
it includes the spherical alternative to the softmax, thus named in [14]. Basically it contains any loss
2
function
P 2 that can be expressed as a function of only the oc associated to non-zero yc and of kok =
j oj the squared norm of the whole output vector, which we can compute cheaply, irrespective of
D, as we did above3 . This family does not include the standard softmax loss log
o2 +
P c 2
j (oj +)

Pexp(oc ) ,
j exp(oj )

but it

does include the spherical softmax4 : log
. Due to space constraints we will not detail this
extension here, only give a sketch of how it can be obtained. Deriving it may not appear obvious at
first, but it is relatively straightforward once we realize that: a) the gain in computing the squared
error loss comes from being able to very cheaply compute the sum of squared activations kok2 (a
scalar quantity), and will thus apply equally well to other losses that can be expressed based on that
quantity (like the spherical softmax). b) generalizing our gradient update trick to such losses follows
naturally from gradient backpropagation: the gradient is first backpropagated from the final loss to
the scalar sum of squared activations, and from there on follows the same path and update procedure
as for the squared error loss.

Experimental validation

We implemented both a CPU version using blas and a parallel GPU (Cuda) version using cublas
of the proposed algorithm5 . We evaluated the GPU and CPU implementations by training word
embeddings with simple neural language models, in which a probability map of the next word
given its preceding n-gram is learned by a neural network. We used a Nvidia Titan Black GPU
and a i7-4820K @ 3.70GHz CPU and ran experiments on the one billion word dataset[15], which
is composed of 0.8 billions words belonging to a vocabulary of 0.8 millions words. We evaluated
the resulting word embeddings with the recently introduced Simlex-999 score [16], which measures
the similarity between words. We also compared our approach to unfactorised versions and to a
two-layer hierarchical softmax. Figure 2 and 3 (left) illustrate the practical speedup of our approach
for the output layer only. Figure 3 (right) shows that out LST (Large Sparse Target) models are
much faster to train than the softmax models and converge to only slightly lower Simlex-999 scores.
Table 1 summarizes the speedups for the different output layers we tried, both on CPU and GPU.
We also empirically verified that our proposed factored algorithm learns the model weights (V U ) as
the corresponding naive unfactored algorithm’s W , as it theoretically should, and followed the same
learning curves (as a function of number of iterations, not time!).

5

Conclusion and future work

We introduced a new algorithmic approach to efficiently compute the exact gradient updates for
training deep networks with very large sparse targets. Remarkably the complexity of the algorithm
is independent of the target size, which allows tackling very large problems. Our CPU and GPU
implementations yield similar speedups to the theoretical one and can thus be used in practical
applications, which could be explored in further work. In particular, neural language models seem
good candidates. But it remains unclear how using a loss function other than the usual softmax might
affect the quality of the resulting word embeddings so further research needs to be carried out in this

to other possible losses in the spherical family such as the spherical-softmax.

Figure 2: Timing of different algorithms. Time taken by forward and backward propagations in the
output layer, including weight update, on a minibatch of size 128 for different sizes of vocabulary
D on both CPU and GPU. The input size d is fixed to 300. The Timing of a 2 layer hierarchical
softmax efficient GPU implementation (h_softmax) is also provided for comparison. Right plot is
in log-log scale. As expected, the timings of factorized versions are independent of vocabulary size.

Figure 3: Left: Practical and theoretical speedups for different sizes of vocabulary D and fixed input
size d=300. The practical unfact / fact speedup is similar to the theoretical one. Right: Evolution
of the Simlex-999 score obtained with different models as a function of training time (CPU softmax
times were extrapolated from fewer iterations). Softmax models are zero hidden-layer models, while
our large sparse target (LST) models have two hidden layers. These were the best architectures
retained in both cases (surprisingly the softmax models with hidden layers performed no better on
this task). The extra non-linear layers in LST may help compensate for the lack of a softmax. LST
models converge to slightly lower scores at similar speed as the hierarchical softmax model but
significantly faster than softmax models.
