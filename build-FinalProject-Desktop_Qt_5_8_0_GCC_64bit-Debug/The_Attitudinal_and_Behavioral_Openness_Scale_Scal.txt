Abstract
The focus of this study is the development and construct validation of the Attitudinal
and Behavioral Openness Scale (ABOS). This scale measures the personality construct of
openness with behavioral and attitudinal indicators. Exploratory and con®rmatory factor
analyses suggest multiple dimensions of the Attitudinal and Behavioral Openness Scale:
Participation in Cultural Activities, Foreign Experiences, Openness Attitudes, and Comfort
with Dierences. Additional analyses establish a nomological network for this construct by
demonstrating convergence between the ABOS and theoretically linked sociopolitical
constructs, attitudinal and personality constructs, in particular a self-rated adjective
measure of openness. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

management strategies in response to both domestic workforce diversity and
global business expansion (Jamieson & O'Mara, 1991; Tung, 1993). Both of these
environmental factors, domestic diversity and global competition, have given rise
to the need for a new type of employee in organizations. The domestic
organization of today needs people who are open and receptive to diversity and
can embrace diversity as a source of competitive advantage for their
organizations. With respect to organizations expanding their operations globally,
they too have a rising need for employees who can work eectively in foreign
environments, with foreign colleagues, clients, etc. Both intra-national and
international diversity, therefore, have fostered the need for employees who
possess the personalities which would enable them to acculturate in cross-cultural
situations.
Personality characteristics: openness
Responding to this human resource need, many organizations are attempting to
select individuals who seem to have personalities more receptive to diversity. In
general, individuals' personality traits are enduring characteristics which
predispose them to behave in certain ways, given particular situations (Buss, 1989;
Costa & McCrae, 1992). For example, people who are extroverted would be more
likely to hold jobs which require public speaking than those who are introverted.
Likewise, those who are intellectual would be more likely to hold cognitively
demanding jobs than those people with less intellect.
Several researchers have suggested a ®ve-factor model of personality (`the BigFive'; McCrae & Costa, 1987; Piedmont, McCrae & Costa, 1991; Trapnell &
Wiggins, 1990) which encompasses all characteristics of personality. The ®ve
personality factors are (1) Extroversion, (2) Agreeableness, (3) Conscientiousness,
(4) Emotional Stability, and (5) Openness.
This study will focus on measurement of the ®fth factor, openness. We believe
that it is this personality characteristic that can ultimately help facilitate the
acceptance of cultural diversity. Individuals higher in openness will have less rigid
views of right and wrong, what is appropriate and inappropriate, etc. (Black,
1990). Those who are less open `view their ideas, norms, and behavior patterns as
correct and others as incorrect . . . and will make little eort to understand'
people from other cultures and backgrounds (Black, 1990).
The Attitudinal and Behavioral Openness Scale (ABOS)
Past studies have demonstrated the relationship between openness (or correlates
of openness) and variables, such as cross-cultural adjustment (e.g., Abe &
Wiseman, 1983; Black, 1990; Hammer, Gudykunst & Wiseman, 1978). These
studies, however, were conducted using one questionnaire of attitudinal-type
measures to assess both the personality dimensions (e.g., openness) and the
criterion (e.g., cross-cultural adjustment). The signi®cant ®ndings in these studies
may have been, in part, due to common method variance (e.g., Black, 1990).

An alternative method for measuring individual characteristics is to consider the
actual behaviors which individuals, who possess the personality characteristic in
question (i.e., openness), demonstrate (Regan & Fazio, 1977). Weigel and
Newman (1976) suggest that when attitude scales are used, they should be
administered in conjunction with behavioral measures to determine the connection
between actions and beliefs. Behaviors and attitudes, therefore, provide evidence
for the existence of a given personality trait in those individuals who self-report
having such personal attributes. With respect to this study, both behavioral
indicators and attitudinal measures related to openness are assessed. For instance,
behavioral evidence which may relate to openness (in a cultural context) may
include, eating at foreign restaurants, having a diverse group of friends, and the
like. Therefore, `attitudinal and behavioral openness' is de®ned as ¯exibility of
one's attitudes and behaviors which result in an individual's ability to function
eectively in diverse cross-national and intra national settings. The attitudes and
behaviors measured by the Attitudinal and Behavioral Openness Scale (ABOS)
provide evidence for the level of the personality trait of openness which may be
present in an individual.
Research on biodata suggests that individuals' past experiences may be used to
predict future individual related outcome variables (Neiner & Owens, 1985; Owens
& Shoenfeldt, 1979). In the case of biodata items related to openness, we would
expect that individuals who possess openness would have the propensity to work
well in cross-cultural situations, to collaborate well with colleagues who are
diverse, to acculturate to foreign countries, etc. The (ABOS) was developed on the
premise that there are certain behaviors individuals exhibit and attitudes
individuals hold which would indicate the presence of the underlying personality
characteristic of opennessÐand the presence of openness would relate to positive
outcomes requiring sensitivity to cultural dierences.
The development of the ABOS represents the overarching goal of this research.
This paper is divided into two sections. The ®rst section describes the scale
development of the ABOS. The second section presents construct validity evidence
to show how this newly developed measure relates to other measures relevant to
this area of research.
Study one: scale development
Item generation
The initial items included in the ABOS were written from a variety of sources.
Some items were based on interviews with successful expatriates after they had
returned to their home country from their experiences abroad. Other items were
based on the authors' personal observations of employees in work situations
requiring openness. All items were measured with 5-point scales. Speci®c scale
anchors varied across items and were based on the stem of the item. For example,
the item, `Other cultures fascinate me' has the anchors of 1=Strongly Disagree to

30

P.M. Caligiuri et al. / International Journal of Intercultural Relations 24 (2000) 27±46

5=Strongly Agree and the item `I eat at a variety of ethnic restaurants' has the
anchors of 1=Never to 5=Frequently. An experimental set of 30 items were
written with the expectation that some items would be dropped, based on the
results of the item analysis. The 30 items were written to measure four theoretical
dimensions of openness: attitudes, participation in cultural activities, past
experiences, and comfort with dierences.
Method
Samples
Sample 1 consisted of 98 male and 159 female undergraduates from a large,
rural, midatlantic university. The average age of the sample was 19.7 years. They
completed the ABOS and received extra credit in their psychology classes. They
were given the ABOS in class and asked to complete all 30 questions. The
questionnaire responses were anonymous. Sample 2 consisted of 116 (49 male and
52 female and 15 subjects who did not indicate their sex) upper level,
undergraduate, management students from a large mid-western university. The
subjects ranged in age from 22 to 49 years old (average age=28.4). The sample
included students of the following ethnic backgrounds: 78 white, 22 black, 4
Hispanic, 4 Asian (8 subjects did not indicate their race). The subjects received
extra credit for anonymously completing the questionnaire in their class.
Psychometric analyses
After the 30 items were written, they were tested so that deviant items could be
identi®ed and dropped. An item was dropped from the scale for any one of
several reasons. For instance, the item may have little or no variance in the
sample of respondents. Also, an item may have a near zero, or negative item total
correlation, suggesting that the item is not measuring the same construct as the
other items on the scale (i.e., low internal consistency). These properties were
examined for all of the items on the original scale. In addition to testing the item
properties, the multidimensional nature of the scale was also analyzed.
Results
Item analyses
The data from the 257 respondents in Sample 1 were used for the analysis of
the scale. First, the item descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and
variance) were examined. The single item distributions did not suggest that any
items should be dropped (items would have been dropped if their means were
extreme, or if their variances were near zero). Next, the item-total correlations
were computed. Six items which had near zero or negative item-total correlations
were dropped. Because of the possibility that items which did not correlate with
the total score could correlate with the factor scores, these six items were reentered for the factor analysis (presented in the Multidimensionality section). The

same six items failed to ®t with any dimension or ®t together as a dimension or
set of dimensions and were subsequently dropped again.
Reliability
An alpha coecient of internal consistency reliability was then computed for
the remaining 24-item ABOS. The resulting alpha was 0.81. By most standards, an
alpha above 0.70 is an indication that a scale is a reliable measureÐand in this
case, internally consistent.
Multidimensionality
The ®rst test of the multidimensionality of the ABOS was an exploratory
principal factor analysis on the 24 retained items. The data from Sample 1 were
used in this analysis. The original solution using the widely accepted root r1
criterion yielded a seven-factor solution (Gorsuch, 1983). Several of these factors
were considered trivial because they did not have a unique set of de®ning
variables (Gorsuch, 1983). In order to improve interpretation four, ®ve, and sixfactor solutions were examined. The four-factor solution maximized simple
structure and was the most interpretable as it had the greatest number of unique
de®ning variables on each factor. This solution was retained. These four factors
had eigenvalues of 4.90, 2.20, 1.87, and 1.75. The percentages of variance
accounted for were 20.4, 9.2, 7.8, and 7.3, respectively. The factors were rotated
using an oblimin (oblique) rotation.
The criterion was to interpret only those items which had factor loadings with
absolute values greater than 0.30. This value was derived from the general
approach whereby the minimum standard error is doubled and the minimum
salient loading is signi®cant at that level (Gorsuch, 1983). With 256 degrees of
freedom and P < 0.05, the minimum value of the correlation coecient is
approximately 0.15, therefore the minimum salient loading is 0.30. Table 1
presents the items, means, standard deviations, and respective factor loadings for
each of the four factors. Next, scores on each dimension were computed for the
sample and a correlation matrix was calculated. The factor intercorrelations are
presented in Table 2. An alpha coecient was calculated for each of the factors to

estimate the internal consistency for each factor. The factor reliabilities appear in
the diagonal of Table 2.
Con®rmatory factor analysis for the ABOS
In order to insure that the four-factor solution is stable and invariant across
groups, con®rmatory factor analysis was applied to the data from Sample 2.
Using the LISREL con®rmatory factor analysis program (JoÈreskog & SoÈrbom,
1989), the best ®tting measurement model was obtained from the Sample 1 data,
then that resulting model was tested on the Sample 2 data. Sample 1 and
Sample 2 data were compared simultaneously to evaluate the stability of the
four factor solution. Analyzing both groups allowed both factor structures to be
compared and more restrictive hypotheses about the factor structures to be
tested. From less to more restrictive hypotheses, the following were tested: (1)
variance/covariance matrix equivalence; (2) equivalent factor patterns; (3)
equivalent magnitudes of the factor loadings; (4) identical error variances across
samples; and (5) invariance of inter-factor variances and covariances. In order to
proceed to testing the next most restrictive hypothesis, the previous hypothesis
must be supported (e.g., before testing (2), support for (1) must be obtained).
The chi-square statistic was used to assess the goodness-of-®t index (GFI) of the
factor structures.
The initial four-factor solution (based on 24 items of the ABOS) from the
Sample 1 data produced a less than adequate ®t. Based on the examination of the
normalized residuals, it was discovered that two items were complex, that is, they
both loaded on three of the four factors. These two items were deleted in two
iterative steps, each producing a signi®cant improvement in the model. The
resulting measurement model (for the remaining 22 items) produced an adequate
®t, w2203  442:96, P < 0.001, GFI=0.865.
The four factor solution was then tested to determine if the same factor
pattern held for Sample 1 and Sample 2 data (i.e., four factors with the same
items loading on the same factors). The ®rst step was to test all four factors
for similar factor patterns. The factor patterns did not ®t the data well,
w2406  848:63, P < 0.001, GFI=0.773. Likewise, the test of metric invariance
for all four factors did not ®t the data w2424  880:75, P < 0.001, GFI=0.760.
Since the four-factor solution was found to vary from Sample 1 to Sample 2,
the factor variances were examined for both samples. For each of the four
factors the variances for Sample 2 (0.815, 0.766, 0.629, and 0.551) were
greater then the variances for Sample 1 (0.444, 0.616, 0.499, and 0.307). Based
on the demographic dierences between Sample 1 and Sample 2 (e.g.,
dierences in ages and location), it made sense that Factor 2 and Factor 4
varied more in Sample 2. Sample 2 was older and located in an urban area
where the opportunities to be involved in many of the activities measured on
the ABOS are greater. It is unclear why Factor 1 and Factor 3 should vary
between Sample 1 and Sample 2 so the model was retested for only these two
factors.
The next step was to test these two factors for similar factor patterns. These

34

factor patterns did ®t the data well, w268  135:82, P < 0.001, GFI=0.890. The
test of metric invariance for the two factors also ®t the data better, w276  149:66,
P < 0.001, GFI=0.880.
Interpretation of the dimensions
Based on the reliability and the multidimensionality results, the ABOS and its
four dimensions were used with con®dence in the next stage of this study.
Although Factor 2 (Foreign Experiences) and Factor 4 (Participation in Cultural
Activities) did not generalize to the second sample in the con®rmatory factor
analysis, they are still retained and used in subsequent analyses for a variety of
reasons. Both Factor 2 and Factor 4 appear to be age dependent. It is logical that
in a population which is above the traditional undergraduate age, both the
opportunities to do more, and the ®nancial resources to participate in cultural
activities would be greater. Sample 2 was an older, non-traditional, working,
sample. In addition, the subjects in Sample 2 attend a university located in a large
city, whereas the subjects in Sample 1 came from a rural area. Again, it is logical
that cultural and foreign opportunities are greater in larger metropolitan areas.
Since these factors were written as behaviorally based items, and to some extent
one's situational constraints will aect or restrict one's behaviors (e.g., lack of
foreign restaurants in small towns), these factors will vary across heterogeneous
demographic groups.
Considering the population to which this work could possibly be generalized
(i.e., working individuals), Factors 2 and 4 must be considered important and
should be further evaluated when additional subjects with similar backgrounds are
surveyed. Given that many organizations are often located in or near major cities,
and that employees are usually older than 19.7 years of age (the mean age of
Sample 1) Factors 2 and 4 could potentially become more important and therefore
should be retained at this early stage of instrument development.
The ®rst dimension identi®ed is Attitudes. This dimension is characterized by
individuals' thoughts and feelings toward people of other cultures and diversity.
People who score highly on this dimension will have positive attitudes toward
diversity and foreign experiences (such as taking an overseas assignment or
hosting a foreign exchange student). In addition, they place these experiences as a
high priority in their lives, and in the lives of their families.
The second dimension is Past Experiences. This dimension measures the extent
to which a person has sought out and participated in foreign and diverse
experiences. Two of the behavioral items included in this dimension are whether
or not one elected to study a foreign language and whether or not one has had
foreign travel experience. It is hypothesized that those who have sought out these
activities have a greater interest in having these experiences and may be more
successful in situations requiring diversity.
The third dimension of the ABOS is Comfort with Dierences. This dimension
is an assessment of the diversity among the types of friends people choose. Very
simply, people who choose to become close with only people who are very similar

to themselves are possibly less comfortable with the dierences of others. Those
higher in openness would be people who are comfortable having relationships
with people dierent from themselves. People who receive a low score on this
dimension have friends and acquaintances with similar (if not identical)
demographic pro®les (e.g., the same race, religious aliation, age, and
socioeconomic status).
The last dimension of the ABOS is Participation in Activities. This dimension is
a behavioral assessment of one's intellectual curiosity for diversity in his or her
experiences. Someone high in the construct of openness would be more likely to
embrace diverse experiences as positive opportunities. People who have high
scores on this dimension would have participated in new and unfamiliar things.
For example, they would eat at foreign restaurants and go to art galleries,
concerts, and museums featuring the works of diverse artists, and so forth.

Study two: construct validation
`A construct represents a hypothesis . . . that a variety of behaviors will
correlate with one another in studies of individual dierences and/or will be
similarly aected by experimental treatments' (Nunnally, 1978. p. 96). This study
identi®es openness as a valid construct and provides evidence that the scale
developed, the Attitudinal and Behavioral Openness Scale, can be used for its
assessment. In order to better understand the construct measured by the ABOS, it
is necessary to examine other constructs which are related to (convergent validity)
and conceptually dierent (discriminant validity) from it. This study presents the
discriminant and convergent validity evidence for the ABOS (and its four
dimensions) by comparing it to 21 other theoretically selected constructs from
three broad categories, (1) sociopolitical attitudes towards foreigners, foreign
goods, etc., (2) individual characteristics linked to openness, and (3) personality
characteristics (the Big Five). (The constructs included are de®ned below along
with the instrument used to measure each, respectively.)
Sociopolitical constructs
The hypothesized relationships among the following sociopolitical constructs
and the ABOS are summarized in the ®rst column of Table 3.
Internationalism
Internationalism is an attitude measure of political and moral ideology toward
other nations. This construct was measured by the 5-item Internationalism Scale
(Kosterman & Feshbach, 1989).
Liberalism
Liberalism is the extent to which one espouses liberal political opinions. This

construct was measured by the 7-item Liberalism Scale (Adorno, FrenkelBrunswik, Levinson & Sanford, 1950).
Ethnocentrism, national smugness, and nationalism
These three constructs represent one's belief in the `superiority' of one's own
country. Individual with these attitudes would believe that other countries are
inferior to their own, and that people from their country can learn little from
people of other cultures. These constructs were measured by the 5-item
Ethnocentrism Scale (Adorno et al., 1950), the 6-item Nationalism Scale
(Kosterman & Feshbach, 1989), and the 4-item Smugness Scale (Kosterman &
Feshbach, 1989).
International relations
International Relations is de®ned as hostility toward other nations, and
attitudes about the correctness of the use of military force in order to protect its
interests. This construct was measured by the 8-item International Relations Scale
(Helfant, 1952).
Consumer ethnocentrism
Consumer ethnocentrism is an individuals' attitudes toward purchasing foreignmade goods. Refusing to buy foreign made goods (i.e., high in consumer
ethnocentrism) suggests that one does not recognize the global economy and the
degree to which the United States bene®ts from participation. This construct was
measured by the 17-item Consumer Ethnocentrism Scale (Shimp & Sharma, 1987).
Patriotism
Patriotism is a healthy love for one's country. (The hypothesis is that openness
toward people of other cultures is not the opposite of patriotism on a continuum.
Since both are separate characteristics, they should not be related to one another.)
This construct was measured by the 7-item Patriotism Scale (Kosterman &
Feshbach, 1989).
Attitudinal constructs
The attitudinal constructs included in this nomological network are listed
below. The hypothesized relationships among the constructs are also found in
Table 4.
Tolerance of ambiguity
Tolerance of ambiguity is the extent to which individuals are comfortable with
novel or unpredictable situations. This construct was measured by the 7-item
Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (MacDonald, 1970; Rydell & Rosen, 1966) and
the 4-item Novelty Scale (another measure of tolerance of ambiguity; Budner,
1962).

Personal need for structure
Individuals' personal need for structure is the extent to which they are likely to
reduce complexity by forming simple cognitive structures about the world. The
negative implication of a person who is high in personal need for structure is that
they tend to stereotype and have prejudices (Neuberg & Newsom, 1993). This
construct was measured by the 11-item Personal Need for Structure Scale
(Thompson, Naccarato & Parker, 1989 cited in Neuberg & Newsom, 1993).
Interpersonal orientation
Black (1988) and Mendenhall and Oddou (1988) found that having strong
relational skills (i.e., interpersonal and social skills) is positively related to crosscultural adjustment. (Interpersonal orientation, or the extent to which individuals
seek out and enjoy being with other people should be positively related to
opennessÐin particular, as it is measured on the comfort with dierences
dimension.) This construct was measured by the 15-item Interpersonal Orientation
Scale (Filsinger, 1981).
Self-monitoring
This construct is the extent to which individuals will adjust their behaviors to ®t
the situation that they are in (i.e., high self monitors) or maintain a steady
demeanor regardless of the situation (i.e., low self-monitors). This construct was
measured by the 18-item Self-Monitoring Scale (Gangestad & Snyder, 1985).
Autonomy
This construct is the extent to which one feels comfortable and enjoys doing
things independently. This was included because employees assigned to work in
foreign countries need to work in situations where they will be without their
familiar supports (Mendenhall & Oddou, 1988). This construct was measured by
the 10-item Autonomy Scale (Lifton, 1983).
Optimism
Given the many dierences associated with situations of diversity, the likelihood
of making mistakes (e.g., not understanding language, not being able to easily
interpret behaviors) is great. A optimist would be someone who has a positive
attitude and will not get discouraged easily (Harvey, 1985). This construct was
measured by the 8-item Optimism Scale (Scheier & Carver, 1985).
Intellectual curiosity
Intellectually curious individuals desire to learn more about other people, other
cultures, other ways of doing things in cross-cultural situations. This desire to
`know more' enables them to more readily learn a new culture and adjust to that
culture (Tung, 1986). Because of its similarity to intellectual curiosity, the
construct, need for cognition, which is an individual's tendency to engage in and
enjoy eortful cognitive endeavors (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) should also be

40

P.M. Caligiuri et al. / International Journal of Intercultural Relations 24 (2000) 27±46

related to openness. This construct was measured by the 18-item Need for
Cognition Scale (Cacioppo, Petty & Kao, 1984).
Positive and negative aect
Positive and negative aect are two orthogonal dimensions of an individual's
mood state. Positive aect, having a high activity and energy level, may be related
to international orientation, assuming that cross cultural situations require greater
energy than situations within one's own cultural bounds. Negative aect focuses
on aversive mood states, such as fear and nervousness. It would be more dicult
for an individual to adjust to a cross cultural situation in a negative mood state,
which suggests that this construct should be related negatively with cross cultural
adjustment. Since positive and negative aect can be induced by a situation, it
may be incorrect to assume that the inverse is true. That is, aect may not
in¯uence the participation in diverse activities. It may, however, be a result from
the behaviors. (In this case, subjects were asked to describe how they are
`usually'.) These constructs were measured by the 20-item Positive and Negative
Aect Scale (Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1988).
Personality constructs
As noted previously, psychologists have identi®ed ®ve orthogonal factors (`the
Big Five') which comprise the taxonomy of personality characteristics (Goldberg,
1992; McCrae & Costa, 1987). These ®ve factors of personality are: (1)
Extraversion; (2) Agreeableness; (3) Conscientiousness; (4) Emotional Stability;
and (5) Openness. Factor 5, openness, should exhibit a positive correlation with
the ABOS given that they are measuring the same underlying personality trait, the
only dierence being that the latter is assessing it in terms of observable attitudes
and behaviors. The other four personality factors should not be related. The ®ve
personality dimensions will be measured by the 100-adjective factor marker
instrument developed by Goldberg (1992).
Method
Samples
From the scale development study (Study 1, above) the sample consisting of 116
upper level, undergraduate, management students, were used to test the
nomological network of sociopolitical constructs. To test the nomological network
or attitudinal and personality constructs, an additional set of 482 subjects (177
male and 298 female, and 7 subjects who did not indicate their sex) from
undergraduate psychology students at a large midatlantic university were sampled.
The subjects ranged in age from 17 to 56 years old (mean age=19.7). The sample
included students of the following ethnic backgrounds: 427 white, 9 black, 9
Hispanic, 1 American Indian, and 27 Asian (9 subjects did not indicate their race).
These subjects received extra credit in their psychology classes for completing the
questionnaire.

Procedure
To test the ®rst (socio-political) nomological network, subjects were given a
packets including the socio-political measures and the Attitudinal and Behavioral
Openness Scale. All of the items were based on 5-point Likert-type scales, except
for the Consumer Ethnocentrism which had a 7-point rating scale. The subjects
were given the questionnaires to complete during their scheduled class meeting
time. They were instructed to respond to each question honestly and to return the
completed questionnaires to the experimenter.
To test the second (attitudinal and personality) nomological network, subjects
were given a packets including the attitudinal measures, personality adjectives, and
the ABOS. All of the items were based on 5-point Likert-type scales, except for
the Self-Monitoring Scale which was measured by true/false items. During their
scheduled experiment session, subjects were instructed to respond to each question
honestly and to return the completed questionnaires to the experimenter.
Results and interpretation
The alpha coecients for all of the scales included in this study are found on
Tables 3 and 4. Six measures were below the generally acceptable level of 0.70
(ABOS Factor 3, Internationalism Scale, International Relations Scale, Smugness
Scale, Liberalism Scale and Ethnocentrism Scale). All subsequent correlational
analyses based on these measures will be understated or lower than they actually
are because they are attenuated by measurement error. As expected, the total
ABOS alpha coecient was higher than any of its four subscales (0.84). This
suggests that the ABOS is comprised of subscales which within themselves are
internally consistent, but can be collectively labeled as one construct.
The correlation matrices for the ABOS and the socio-political and attitudinal
and personality constructs are reported in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. In the
socio-political nomological network, neither patriotism nor nationalism were
found to be related to any of the four ABOS dimensions or overall ABOS score.
Nationalism and patriotism were correlated (r = 0.36, P < 0.01). As
hypothesized, patriotism should not have been related, because one can have both
a healthy love for his or her own country as well as an openness to other
countries. Based on the correlation between nationalism and patriotism, these two
are probably similar constructs or parts of a broader construct which is not
related to openness. Surprisingly, ethnocentrism was not negatively related to
openness. This may be explained in that ethnocentrism and nationalism were
correlated (r = 0.48, P < 0.01) ±possibly neither are pure measures of the
constructs intended.
Internationalism correlated with the overall ABOS, and all of its factors
independently except for Factor 2, Past Experiences. Although causal inference
cannot be made, it was anticipated that more foreign experience would be related
to higher internationalism. This may have been an incorrect assumption on our
part, given that we assumed a quantitative dierence in amount of foreign
experience. We did not account for the qualitative dierences in foreign

42

P.M. Caligiuri et al. / International Journal of Intercultural Relations 24 (2000) 27±46

experience. For example, people may have several very bad experiences overseas
or, on the contrary, one very positive experience. This may be an explanation for
why no relationship was found between Foreign Experiences and Internationalism.
Consumer ethnocentrism, international relations, ethnocentrism, and smugness
about one's own country were all signi®cantly and negatively correlated with
Factor 1 of the ABOS (Attitudes), and the latter two with the overall ABOS. This
is explicable if we assume that international relations, consumer ethnocentrism,
and smugness are measures of an `us versus them' mentality. This may suggest
that people with greater openness recognize the global marketplace and see the
positive aspects of foreign trade. Similarly, people with higher openness may see
greater unity among nations. They do not consider other countries and foreign
competition as threatening to them or their own country. The signi®cant negative
correlation between the ABOS Factor 2, which is Participation in Cultural
Activities, and consumer ethnocentrism makes intuitive sense as well. Those who
are more culturally active look to other cultures (as well as their own) for
recreational activities, likewise those who are low in consumer ethnocentrism look
to other countries (as well as their own) for consumer goods.
Factors 2 and 3 (Past Experiences and Comfort with Dierences) and liberalism
correlated signi®cantly. This association is interesting because it links actual
experiences of foreign cultures and dierent people with liberal political attitudes.
It might be the same underlying personal characteristic which aligns one with
political liberalism, also predisposing one to be acceptant of other cultures and
other people.
For the attitudinal and personality constructs, almost all of the individual
characteristics which were hypothesized (on Tables 3 and 4) to be linked to
openness had signi®cant correlations with the ABOS. Tolerance of ambiguity and
personal need for structure were related to all dimensions of behavioral openness
except past experiences. This could indicate that people who are able to tolerate
more ambiguity and less structure, are better able to adjust to culturally diverse
situations once they are in them, but do not necessarily seek out foreign
experiences more than others.
Interpersonal orientation was only related to Factor 3, comfort with dierences.
This factor is the only one with an interpersonal component, that is, one which
requires relational skills. Likewise, self-monitoring was only slightly related to
Factor 4, participation in cultural activities. This makes sense taking into account
the dierent emphasis that low and high self-monitors place on the social
situation. High self monitors may participate in cultural events (whether they
intrinsically enjoy them or not) to ®t in a given social environment. Low self
monitors may participate in cultural activities, only if they truly enjoy them.
Taken together, whether they enjoy cultural activities or not, high self monitors
may participate more in cultural activities, making them higher in this dimension
of behavioral openness.
As it is measured in this study, a low score on the autonomy scale indicates
higher autonomy. All dimensions of the ABOS were related to autonomy. This
may indicate that people who are less concerned with the norms of a social

P.M. Caligiuri et al. / International Journal of Intercultural Relations 24 (2000) 27±46

43

situation, will be more likely to do what they pleaseÐincluding spending time
with foreign people, participating in a variety of cultural events, etc. This assumes,
of course, that the free thinking autonomous individuals participate in more
diverse things than the societal norm. (Given that these data were collected on a
sample of highly homogeneous undergraduates this result would make sense.)
As it is measured in this study, a low score on the optimism scale indicates
higher optimism. Optimism is not related to either comfort with dierences or
past experiences, but is related to attitudes and participation in cultural activities.
The nonsigni®cant correlations can be explained in that people who are more
optimistic may be more optimistic and enjoy diverse situations more once they are
in them, but do not necessarily seek out these experiences to any great extent. For
experiences common to more people (that is, things that almost everyone in this
sample can experience, such as eating at foreign restaurants and going to
museums) more optimistic people may be willing to try new things more
frequently because they believe that they will enjoy them. Positive aect was
related to all facets of behavioral openness, except comfort with dierences. Since
positive aect is an assessment individual mood state, it may be true that it is
related to the attitudes and behaviors of the individual, but unrelated to relational
experiences involving others (i.e., as assessed by Factor 3). Negative aect was not
related to any of the ABOS factors.
Intellectual curiosity (i.e., need for cognition) was found to be positively related
to all factors of the ABOS. Unlike most of the other personal characteristics
assessed by this study, this construct assesses those who would actively seek out
international oriented activities. People who are higher in intellectual curiosity do
things which allow them to learn more about other people, other cultures, other
ways of doing thingsÐprecisely the behaviors that the ABOS was assessing.
With regard to the personality dimensions, principal axis factor analysis with a
varimax rotation (i.e., orthogonal rotation) was conducted on the Big Five factor
markers, as suggested by Goldberg (1992). As hypothesized, behavioral openness
loaded on the Openness personality factor (i.e., 0.40), and had a near-zero loading
on the other four factors. When factor scores retained and used for correlational
analyses openness, as expected, had the highest positive correlation with the
ABOS. Extraversion also correlated signi®cantly, but to a lesser extent. This result
provides the strongest convergent validity evidence between openness, measured
by the ABOS, and self-reported adjective measure of openness.
Discussion
The focus of this study was the development and construct validation of the
Attitudinal and Behavioral Openness Scale (ABOS). From the reliability and
construct validity evidence presented, we believe that the ABOS is a useful
measure of the personality construct, openness. Past studies have suggested that a
relationship exists between openness and criteria variables, such as cross-cultural
adjustment (e.g., Abe & Wiseman, 1983; Black, 1990; Hammer, Gudykunst &

44

P.M. Caligiuri et al. / International Journal of Intercultural Relations 24 (2000) 27±46

Wiseman, 1978). We believe that the ABOS could be used in future studies
predicting expatriate cross-cultural adjustment. Consonant with the bene®ts of the
ABOS for global assignments, this measure could possibly be used to predict who
would be most likely to bene®t from (or be in the greatest need of) cross-cultural
training.
In addition to global assignments, the ABOS could be used in other situations
which require the prediction of a person who is `open'. For example, the
successful management of domestic workforce diversity (or intra-national
diversity) has also given rise to the need to identify people who possess the
characteristic `openness'. As one possibility, the ABOS could be added to a
diversity training program to promote self-awareness. The ABOS may also be
used to identify who would be most successful in (or bene®t the most from) a
multicultural work team.
A current limitation of the ABOS is that it focused on mostly objective,
behavioral indicators of openness, future studies should also include the both
biographical variables and additional attitudinal variables which aect
behaviors. The biographical variables could include marital status,
socioeconomic status, education level, geographical region, among others. It is
possible that the behaviors assessed by the ABOS are the products of both
individuals' predisposing personality characteristics and their demographic
backgrounds. For example, dimension 4, Participation in Cultural Activities,
could be aected by both individuals' desire to experience new things, as well
as their income and geographic location which enable participation in the
activities. Since the aim of this research should be the identi®cation of the true
individual dierences on a personality trait, further research is needed in this
area.
Based on this preliminary research, we believe the ABOS warrants further study
and development. Additional questions should be added to the original four
dimensions to improve the subscale internal consistencies. Preliminary work on
the scale has been conducted with student populations and further research should
be conducted to test the scale with working samples. Criterion-related validity
studies should also be conducted to relate openness with some external criteria,
such as performance on a global assignment, performance in a diversity training
program, performance on a multicultural work team, etc.
