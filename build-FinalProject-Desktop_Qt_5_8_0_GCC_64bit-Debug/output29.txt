Abstract
A study was conducted to determine university students’ perceptions on entrepreneurial
self- efficacy and entrepreneurial intention. Data were collected via questionnaire. The
study utilized a descriptive research design and 1,554 university students participated in it.
Each set of research constructs has a reliability value range between .74 and .96. Findings
indicate that the students had moderate score on all constructs related to entrepreneurial
intention and entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the aspects of management, financial and
marketing. Moreover, students with positive entrepreneurial aspiration scored higher in
entrepreneurship intention and self-efficacy which is significantly different from those who
do not have positive aspiration. The students also scored moderately on attitudes towards
entrepreneurial career and perceived behavioral control. The findings also indicate that
those who perceived entrepreneurship need to be learnt at university have significantly
higher mean score on attitudes towards entrepreneurial career as well as perceived
behavioral control. Based on the findings of this study, it is suggested that to improve
university students’ entrepreneurial intention and self-efficacy, certain teaching strategies
needed to be conducted and university policy makers should add more value to their
graduates by incorporating the elements that enhance the development of entrepreneurial
intention and self-efficacy in the aspects of management, financial and marketing
competencies as a basis to choose entrepreneurship as a career choice.
Keywords: Entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurship
education, institutions of higher learning.

Introduction
Self-efficacy is the strong personal belief in skills and abilities to initiate a task and lead it to success
(Bandura, 1997). According to Markham, et. al. (2002), it is the perceptions of self-efficacy, rather
than objective ability that motivates individuals to demonstrate entrepreneurial behavior. Unlike other
personality traits of entrepreneurship which are relatively static, self-efficacy is affected by contextual
factors such as education and past experiences (Hollenbeck & Hall, 2004). Some researchers believe
that self-efficacy is similar to other personal traits such as locus of control, although they are different
in some aspects. ‘Locus of control’ is the overall belief in ones’ power over the outcomes of actions,
whereas self-efficacy is profound self-confidence in accomplishing specific tasks (Boyd & Vozikis,
1994). Moreover, self-efficacy is domain specific and varies across tasks and situations (Wilson,
Kickul, & Marlino, 2007) it can also be generalized to other related tasks or performances (Chen,
Greene, & Crick, 1998). More interestingly, self-efficacy is one of the core components of
entrepreneurial intention models and mostly operationalized as feasibility, although there are some
subtle technical differences between them (Ajzen, 2002; Segal, Borgia & Schoenfeld, 2005).

Purposeful education enhances students’ entrepreneurial efficacy through providing them
attitudes, knowledge and skills to cope with the complexities embedded in entrepreneurial tasks such
as opportunity seeking, resource assembling, and leading the business to success (Wilson, Kickul &
Marlino, 2007). In fact, education enhances entrepreneurial efficacy of students through providing
experience of mastery, role models, social persuasion and support by involving them in hands-on
learning activities, business plan development, and running simulated or real small business (Fiet,
2000; Segal, Borgia & Schoenfeld, 2005). Furthermore, education plays a crucial role in developing
students’ entrepreneurial efficacy through involving them in various entrepreneurial activities and
increasing their desirability to step into venture creation by highlighting the merits, values and
advantages of entrepreneurship (Segal, Borgia & Schoenfeld, 2005); as well as encouraging and
supporting them to start-up their own business.
Hence, improving student’s entrepreneurial efficacy enables them to put more efforts over a
longer time, persist the challenges and develop plans and strategies to achieve higher entrepreneurial
goals (Shane, Locke & Collins, 2003). In addition, higher entrepreneurial efficacy is associated with
higher intention to become an entrepreneur (Segal, Borgia & Schoenfeld, 2005). Although, there is few
empirical evidence on the influence of entrepreneurship education and training on entrepreneurial
efficacy (Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998). Chen, Greene and Crick (1998) introduced entrepreneurial
self-efficacy (ESE) as the criteria to distinguish entrepreneurs from those who do not intend to create
their own business. Choosing entrepreneurship, management, and organizational psychology students
as the participants of the study, they conclude that entrepreneurship education was effective in
developing entrepreneurial self-efficacy and consequently intention of students to set up their own
business.
On the impacts of education in entrepreneurial capability development of students, Rae and
Carswell (2000) proposed a model at the heart of which is self-efficacy. They looked at the process of
learning entrepreneurial behaviour through a lens of life-story process and argued that entrepreneurs’
self-confidence and self-belief is highly affected by active learning, relations, known capabilities, and
personal theory. They act as motivational engine of entrepreneurial capabilities. Importantly, selfefficacy increases over time and through involving in experiential learning activities.
Zhao, Seibert, and Hills (2005) also stressed the mediating role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy
on the relationship between entrepreneurship courses and university students’ entrepreneurial intention.
They argued that entrepreneurship education should not only focus on technical aspects of
entrepreneurship, but it also should strengthen students’ self-confidence to become entrepreneurs
through offering them variety of learning opportunities.
The Emergence of Entrepreneurship Intention Models
The attempt to identify who wants to become an entrepreneur, how a successful entrepreneur behave,
and which factors affect the decision to create a venture, has lead to the emergence of two main
streams of entrepreneurship research. First, the researchers focused on linking certain personality traits
or characteristics such as ‘self-efficacy’ (Ajzen, 2002; Wilson, Kickul, & Marlino, 2007), ‘need for
achievement’ (McClelland, 1961; Hansemark, 1998) and ‘tolerance for ambiguity’ (Teoh & Foo, 1997)
to entrepreneurial behaviour based on the assumption that entrepreneurs are endowed with unique traits
which make them distinguishable from others (Gu¨rol & Atsan, 2006) and motivate their
entrepreneurial behaviours (Mueller & Thomas, 2000). Through the next stream, scholars investigated
the contributions of demographic and contextual factors such as age, gender, work experience, and job
dissatisfaction in mobilizing entrepreneurship behaviour (Liñán et al., 2005; Wilson, Kickul &
Marlino, 2007).
According to Bird (1998), intention is the state of mind directing a person’s attentions and
action towards self-employment as opposed to organizational employment. Intention has been also
defined as the efforts of a person to carry out entrepreneurial behaviour (Liñán & Rodríguez, 2004). It
is the result of perceived control over behaviour (perceived ability to perform entrepreneurial
339

European Journal of Social Sciences – Volume 9, Number 2(2009)
behaviour); attitude toward behaviour (the degree to which a person has a positive or negative
evaluation or appraisal of entrepreneurial behaviour); and subjective and social norms (the perceptions
of how significant others think about being an entrepreneur, the strength of the motivation to comply
with them, and social support to carry out the entrepreneurial behaviour). All these factors act as the
motivation and emotional tendency which influence and direct entrepreneurial behaviour. Importantly,
these factors can be affected by ‘exogenous influences’ such as personality traits and education (Borgia
& Schoenfeld, 2005; Liñán, et. al., 2005; Souitaris, Zerbinati & Al-Laham, 2007).
Attitudes towards self-employment are the difference between perceptions of personal
desirability to become self-employed or employed by an organization. Therefore ‘high’ attitude
towards self-employment actually indicates that the respondent is more in favor of self-employment
than organizational employment (Kolvereid, 1996).
Kolvereid and Isaken (2006) defined self-employment as the situation in which individuals are
faced with two alternatives when selecting a career – either as self-employed or employed in an
organization. An attitude towards self-employment is an individual perception on working as the owner
of a business. Jackson and Rodkey (1994) argued that an attitude towards entrepreneurship is an
important aspect which predict potential entrepreneur in future. Previous studies showed that attitudes
towards self-employment associated with self-employment intentions (Kolvereid & Isaken, 2006). For
instance, Kolvereid and Isaken reported that attitude towards self-employment predicts selfemployment intentions (β =.33, p < .001). Currently, little is known about the actual impacts of
entrepreneurship education programs on developing entrepreneurial intention of students particularly in
universities (Collins, Hannon, & Smith, 2006). Through a longitudinal study over a period of 18
months, Audet (2002) questioned the temporal stability of entrepreneurial intention of undergraduate
university students from business administration programs. The study has some significant findings.
First, it confirms the validity of the Theory of Planned Behaviour to explain students’ intention to go
into a business at some point in their life. Second, entrepreneurial intention varies over time; therefore,
it is difficult to establish the association between entrepreneurial intention and actual venture creation.
Finally, entrepreneurial intention changes due to the impacts of some positive factors (e.g. being more
mature, being your own boss, money, freedom, and opportunity recognition) and negative factors
(reality shock and corporate orientation). Liñán, et. al., (2005) applied Theory of planned Behaviour to
investigate entrepreneurial intention of 354 undergraduate students of Business Science and Economics
in two public universities. The findings indicate that intention is a function of perceived self-efficacy
(control over behaviour); personal attitudes; and perceived subjective and social norms. Interestingly,
entrepreneurial knowledge affects entrepreneurial intention but through interaction with antecedents of
intention particularly perceived self-efficacy.
From Luthje and Franke’s (2003) point of view, successful research universities seem to
promote entrepreneurial activities among students. They claimed that it is widely unknown whether
contextual founding conditions or rather personality traits that drive the students’ career decision
towards self-employment. Scott and Twomey (1988) argued that in order to design effective programs,
policy makers have to know which of the factors mentioned above should be heavily emphasized. The
findings of the study conducted by Autio et. al (1997) revealed that the career preferences and
entrepreneurial conviction are influenced by the image of entrepreneurship as a career alternative and
the support received from the university environment. Whitlock and Masters (1996) found that after
four years of following business courses the business students’ interest in pursuing self- employment
seemed to dissipate. This argument had resulted in a desire to conduct a research with the aim of
investigating the entrepreneurial self efficacy and entrepreneurial intention of university students.
Based on the above literature review the following research questions were developed:
1. What is the perception of university students on their entrepreneurial intentions?
2. What is the perception of university students regarding specific entrepreneurial efficacy
such as general management, finance, and marketing?
340

European Journal of Social Sciences – Volume 9, Number 2 (2009)
3. Is there any significant difference between perceptions of university students regarding
entrepreneurial intention and self-efficacy based on their entrepreneurial aspiration?
4. What are the perception of students regarding their attitudes towards entrepreneurial career
and perceived behavioral control?
5. What are the perceptions of students regarding attitudes toward entrepreneurial career and
perceived behavior control based on the needs to learn entrepreneurship at university?

Methodology
The study utilized a descriptive research design. The sample comprised of 1,554 university students
from three research universities in Malaysia. Data were gathered in March 2008 using a set of
questionnaire measuring students’ background information, entrepreneurial intention, attitudes toward
entrepreneurial career, perceived behavioral control, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the aspect of
management, financial and marketing. Permissions to conduct the research were obtained from Vice
Chancellor of each university and also the Dean of the selected faculties. Data were collected by the
researcher and two research assistants who had been trained to properly conduct a good quality
research.
The instrument was developed based on the modification of previous instruments developed by
several authors such as Ajzen and Fishbein (1980), Kolvereid (1996), Krueger (2000), Chen, Green
and Crick (1998), Zaidatol (1993), and Hassan (2007). The reliability of each set of constructs has a
Cronbach α value ranged between .74 and .96. The measurement of items in the survey questionnaire
was based on 5 point Likert scales with 1 demonstrating “strongly disagree” to 5 demonstrating
“strongly agree”. Negatively worded items were rescored so that higher scores reflected its mean.
Mean score above 3.80 is considered high, 3.40-3.79 considered moderate and below 3.39 considered
as low perceptions. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. (Table 1)

Findings
Table 2 illustrates that in general students perceived moderately on all items measuring entrepreneurial
intention with the exception of item 9, that is “I want to be my own boss” (mean=4.01, s.d= 0.96). The
least mean score is for these items as “I have thought seriously to start my own business after
completing my study” (mean=3.22, s.d=1.03) and “I prefer to be an entrepreneur rather than be an
employee in a company (mean 3.42, s.d.=1.05).

Table 4a and 4b show that there exists a significant difference between the two groups of
students in all constructs such as entrepreneurial intention, attitude towards entrepreneurial career, and
perceived behavioral control. Findings also indicate that there is a significant difference regarding
entrepreneurial efficacy in marketing competencies, managerial and financial competencies. This
shows that entrepreneurship related courses and training are needed to increase the university students’
entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial efficacy. It was found that student with positive
entrepreneurship aspiration score higher in entrepreneurship intention and self-efficacy and it is
significantly different from those who do not have positive aspiration.

To answer the questions on what are the perceptions of students on attitude towards
entrepreneurial career and perceived behavioral control based on the need to learn entrepreneurship at
university, findings indicate that 1,035 students (66%) perceived that university students should learn
entrepreneurship and 488 of them (31%) did not perceive learning entrepreneurship as to be important
at university. t-test analysis indicate that those who think that university students should learn
entrepreneurship, scored higher entrepreneurial intention compared to those who do not, as illustrated
in table 6.

Discussion
Binks, et. al (2006) claimed that understanding and developing entrepreneurship requires an integrated
research and teaching effort. This is consistent with the claim made by Shook et. al (2003) that
entrepreneurship is about entrepreneurial individuals interacting with their environment to discover,
evaluate and exploit opportunities. This research focused on the perceptions of students in universities,
thus it would be better to relate entrepreneurship to students’ career perception, because
entrepreneurship involves developing knowledge, skills, attitudes, and personal qualities appropriate to
the age and development of students in educational settings or environment. The study found that
entrepreneurial intention score is higher if students perceived there is a need to learn entrepreneurship
at the university. This finding is important in that if students understand the necessity and need of
having entrepreneurship education, their intention to become an entrepreneur increases. This
necessitates developing effective entrepreneurship education to explain them the necessities and
benefits of self-employment. This finding is inconsistent with the current role of universities in
development of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship education is fundamental and also demanded by
large organizations in order to acquire the flexibility and responsive dexterity of small business and
individual entrepreneurs. It is also needed to enable creative solutions in the public sectors such as
health and education (Binks, et. al. 2006).
The findings showed that the need to learn business and entrepreneurship through education are
essential to ensure university students have the ability to possess all the pertinent ingredients to equip
themselves with entrepreneurial efficacy. This finding concurs with Lussiers and Pfeifer’s (2001)
findings, where entrepreneur with higher education level, industrial and managerial experience, and
business exposure have greater chance of succeeding in their business. The basic skill necessary to
meet this challenge is the ability to recognize a market needs and the ability to develop a product or
service appropriate to satisfy these needs. In this sense, entrepreneurial self-efficacy is the strong
personal belief in skills and abilities to start-up a business and leading it to success. Accordingly, those
who are higher on entrepreneurial efficacy are more interested to be engaged in entrepreneurial
activities and feel confident in facing the challenges and removing the obstacles in the process of
venture creation (Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998) and lead the venture to success and growth.
This study also found that university students who need business and entrepreneurship
education exposure scored a higher mean in entrepreneurial intention as compared to the other group of
students and the difference is highly significant. The findings are in accord with Chen Greene, and
Crick’s (1998) findings, who reported that the number of management courses MBA students had
taken, were positively related to entrepreneurial intention. The findings of the researchers suggest that
university students who are given opportunities to learn more business management and
entrepreneurship related courses motivate them to become self-employed. Students’ attitudes towards
entrepreneurial career, perceived behavioral control as well as entrepreneurial efficacy seem to be the
best predictors of students’ entrepreneurial intention. The current study coincides with Ajzen’s (1987)
study which is also consistent with Kolvereid’s (1997) study where attitude and perceived behavior
control contribute significantly to the explanation of intention.
Based on the findings of this study, it is suggested that to improve university students’
entrepreneurial intention and self- efficacy, certain teaching strategies need to be conducted in addition
to the traditional ones. This is related to the previous argument made in the literature that
entrepreneurial experience is associated with entrepreneurial abilities and entrepreneurial intention.
Kuratko (2005) claimed that participation in entrepreneurial training programs has been associated
with changes in attitudes and intentions towards entrepreneurship and they need proper teaching
strategies compatible with the student-centered approach. This is because Rasmussen and Sorheim
(2006) as well as Frank et. al. (2005) reported that students’ development of their entrepreneurial
intention was affected by the entrepreneurial instructions they received such as team oriented method
and learning-by-doing hands-on activities. In entrepreneurial training programs, it is important to
provide students training in the essential competencies such as management, financial and marketing
344

European Journal of Social Sciences – Volume 9, Number 2 (2009)
competencies because as suggested by Terpstra and Olson (1993), many business failures were due to
lack of management skills or competencies and the three major reasons why businesses fail were
because of financial difficulties, product or market problems and managerial problems (Bruno et al,
1987). The current study also found that students with positive entrepreneurship aspiration score higher
mean in all competencies (financial, marketing, and management). Audet (2000) reported that students’
perception of the desirability and feasibility of stepping into business were measured before and after
they had taken a course in entrepreneurship and some significant differences were found. Thus, the
tendency of the current study to be in agreement with Audet’s report is highly probable. Since, the
results of this study showed that students with entrepreneurship exposure scored significantly different
in entrepreneurial intention.
This study also found that university students’ who need entrepreneurial exposure scored higher
mean in attitude towards entrepreneurship career, and perceived behavioral control. This had supported
Shapero’s (1982) findings where it was argued that attitudes toward entrepreneurship should partly
derive from prior exposure to entrepreneurial activity and affect intentions through changing attitudes.
In addition, Ajzen (1987) pointed that the concept of perceived behavioral control is closely related to
the concept of self-efficacy because both concepts refer to perceived factors that are specific to the
attainments of a given behavior. Thus, both concepts are similar because the acquisition of skills
through past achievement reinforces individuals to develop entrepreneurial intentions. Since, selfefficacy is proposed as an important explanatory variable in determining the strength of intention, it is
suggested that in order to develop university students self-efficacy or perceived behavioral control,
university teaching and learning should focus on providing mastery experience or repeated
performance accomplishment as suggested by Wood and Bandura (1989). They emphasized that when
people experience success the easy way, they become quickly discouraged by failure when it occurs.
So, in order to gain a more stable and resilient source of self-efficacy, it is necessary to have alternative
solutions or strategies in overcoming obstacles through effort and perseverance. The current study
illustrated that proper entrepreneurship education exposure will enable students to have positive image
in choosing entrepreneurship as a career.
This study found that students’ attitude towards entrepreneurial career is in the category of
moderate. These students may not be concerned with the feasibility of becoming an entrepreneur rather
they may focus on the direction that their studies should prepare them for an organizational career. As
explain by Douglas and Shepherd (2000), who argued that the decision to be an entrepreneur may be
modeled as a utility-maximizing career choice made by an individual. That is, people choose to be selfemployed if the total utility they expect to derive (via income, independence, risk bearing, work effort,
and perquisites associated with self-employment) is greater than the expected utility from their best
employment option.
In relation to this, the mean score on entrepreneurial self-efficacy is only moderate and mean
score on perceived behavioral control is also moderate. Thus, it is important to support offering
entrepreneurship courses to all university students so as to improve their entrepreneurial intention as
suggested by Peterman and Kennedy (2003) and Souitaris, Zerbinati, and Al-Laham (2007) who found
that exposure to entrepreneurship education increases entrepreneurial intention.
In addition, Douglas and Shepherd (2002) found that there is a relationship between
entrepreneurial attitudes and the intention to be self-employed. They reported that the intention to be
self-employed is stronger for those with more positive attitudes to risk and to independence. That is,
the higher is the individual’s tolerance for risk, and the stronger is their preference for decision-making
autonomy, the stronger is their intention to be self-employed. To be able to possess the positive
attitudes such as tolerance for risk and ability to make decision, university students need to learn and
have enough knowledge in different aspects of management, financial and marketing.

Conclusions and Implications
This work substantially expands the understanding of what drives the intention of university students to
become an entrepreneur. It helps to understand the importance of entrepreneurial exposure in term of
management, finance and marketing competencies as a basis to choose entrepreneurship as a career
choice. The study also focuses on the “why” of entrepreneurship rather than the “when” because the
focus is on the internal motivations of individuals rather than the extend inducements of the economic
environment.
University students participated in this study have moderate entrepreneurial intention. Since,
the intention to start one’s own business appears to be driven by “more entrepreneurial” attitudes
towards entrepreneurial career. University policy makers and educators might encourage selfemployment by facilitating the development of more entrepreneurial intention, attitudes and
entrepreneurial self-efficacy in the aspects of management, financial and marketing. University should
add more value to their graduates if they incorporate into their curriculum elements that enhance the
development of entrepreneurial attitudes and self-efficacy, since these are beneficial to both a selfemployment and employment career path.
