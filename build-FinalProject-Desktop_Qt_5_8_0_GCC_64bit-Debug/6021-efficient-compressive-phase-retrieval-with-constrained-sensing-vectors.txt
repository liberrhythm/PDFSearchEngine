Abstract
We propose a robust and efficient approach to the problem of compressive phase
retrieval in which the goal is to reconstruct a sparse vector from the magnitude
of a number of its linear measurements. The proposed framework relies on constrained sensing vectors and a two-stage reconstruction method that consists of
two standard convex programs that are solved sequentially.
In recent years, various methods are proposed for compressive phase retrieval, but
they have suboptimal sample complexity or lack robustness guarantees. The main
obstacle has been that there is no straightforward convex relaxations for the type
of structure in the target. Given a set of underdetermined measurements, there is a
standard framework for recovering a sparse matrix, and a standard framework for
recovering a low-rank matrix. However, a general, efficient method for recovering
a jointly sparse and low-rank matrix has remained elusive.
Deviating from the models with generic measurements, in this paper we show that
if the sensing vectors are chosen at random from an incoherent subspace, then the
low-rank and sparse structures of the target signal can be effectively decoupled.
We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank recovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate estimate of the target
when the number of measurements is O(k log kd ), where k and d denote the sparsity level and the dimension of the input signal. We also evaluate the algorithm
through numerical simulation.

Introduction
Problem setting

The problem of Compressive Phase Retrieval (CPR) is generally stated as the problem of estimating
a k-sparse vector x? ∈ Rd from noisy measurements of the form
2

yi = |hai , x? i| + zi

(1)

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, where ai is the sensing vector and zi denotes the additive noise. In this paper,
we study the CPR problem with specific sensing vectors ai of the form
ai = Ψ T wi ,

(2)

where Ψ ∈ Rm×d and wi ∈ Rm are known. In words, the measurement vectors live in a fixed
low-dimensional subspace (i.e, the row space of Ψ ). These types of measurements can be applied in
imaging systems that have control over how the scene is illuminated; examples include systems that
use structured illumination with a spatial light modulator or a scattering medium [1, 2].

we can write the measurements compactly as
y = A (X ? ) + z.
Our goal is to estimate the sparse, rank-one, and positive semidefinite matrix X ? from the measurements (3), which also solves the CPR problem and provides an estimate for the sparse signal x? up
to the inevitable global phase ambiguity.
Assumptions We make the following assumptions throughout the paper.
A1. The vectors wi are independent and have the standard Gaussian distribution on Rm : wi ∼
N (0, I) .
A2. The matrix Ψ is a restricted isometry matrix for 2k-sparse vectors and for a constant δ2k ∈
[0, 1]. Namely, it obeys
2

(1 − δ2k ) kxk2 ≤ kΨ xk22 ≤ (1 + δ2k ) kxk22 ,

(4)

for all 2k-sparse vectors x ∈ Rd .
A3. The noise vector z is bounded as kzk2 ≤ ε.
As will be seen in Theorem 1 and its proof below, the Gaussian distribution imposed by the assumption A1 will be used merely to guarantee successful estimation of a rank-one matrix through trace
norm minimization. However, other distributions (e.g., uniform distribution on the unit sphere) can
also be used to obtain similar guarantees. Furthermore, the restricted isometry condition imposed
by the assumption A2 is not critical and can be replaced by weaker assumptions. However, the guarantees obtained under these weaker assumptions usually require more intricate derivations, provide
weaker noise robustness, and often do not hold uniformly for all potential target signals. Therefore,
to keep the exposition simple and straightforward we assume (4) which is known to hold (with high
probability) for various ensembles of random matrices (e.g., Gaussian, Rademacher, partial Fourier,
etc). Because in many scenarios we have the flexibility of selecting Ψ , the assumption (4) is realistic
as well.
Notation Let us first set the notation used throughout the paper. Matrices and vectors are denoted
by bold capital and small letters, respectively. The set of positive integers less than or equal to
n is denoted by [n]. The notation f = O (g) is used when f = cg for some absolute constant
c > 0. For any matrix M , the Frobenius norm, the nuclear norm, the entrywise `1 -norm, and the
largest entrywise absolute value of the entries are denoted by kM kF , kM k∗ , kM k1 , and kM k∞ ,
respectively. To indicate that a matrix M is positive semidefinite we write M < 0.

Contributions

The main challenge in the CPR problem in its general formulation is to design an accurate estimator
that has optimal sample complexity and computationally tractable. In this paper we address this
challenge in the special setting where the sensing vectors can be factored as (2). Namely, we propose
an algorithm that

• provably produces an accurate estimate of the lifted target X ? from only n = O k log kd
measurements, and
• can be computed in polynomial time through efficient convex optimization methods.

Related work

Several papers including [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have already studied the application of convex programming
for (non-sparse) phase retrieval (PR) in various settings and have established estimation accuracy
through different mathematical techniques. These phase retrieval methods attain nearly optimal
sample complexities that scales with the dimension of the target signal up to a constant factor [4, 5, 6]
or at most a logarithmic factor [3]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the exiting methods for
CPR either lack accuracy and robustness guarantees or have suboptimal sample complexities.
The problem of recovering a sparse signal from the magnitude of its subsampled Fourier transforms
is cast in [8] as an `1 -minimization with non-convex constraints. While [8] shows that a sufficient
number of measurements would grow quadratically in k (i.e., the sparsity of the signal), the numerical simulations suggest that the non-convex method successfully estimates the sparse signal with
only about k log kd measurements. Another non-convex approach to CPR is considered in [9] which
poses the problem as finding a k-sparse vector that minimizes the residual error that takes a quartic
form. A local search algorithm called GESPAR [10] is then applied to (approximate) the solution
to the formulated sparsity-constrained optimization. This approach is shown to be effective through
simulations, but it also lacks global convergence or statistical accuracy guarantees. An alternating
minimization method for both PR and CPR is studied in [11]. This method is appealing in large
scale problems because of computationally inexpensive iterations. More importantly, [11] proposes
a specific initialization using which the alternating minimization method is shown to converge linearly in noise-free PR and CPR. However, the number of measurements required to establish this
convergence is effectively quadratic in k. In [12] and [13] the `1 -regularized form of the trace
minimization
argmin
X<0

trace (X) + λ kXk1
(5)

subject to A (X) = y
is proposed for the CPR problem. The guarantees of [13] are based on the restricted isometry propn
erty of the sensing operator X 7→ [hai a∗i , Xi]i=1 for sparse matrices. In [12], however, the analysis is based on construction of a dual certificate through an adaptation of the golfing scheme [14].
Assuming standard Gaussian sensing vectors ai and with appropriate choice of
 the regularization
parameter λ, it is shown in [12] that (5) solves the CPR when n = O k 2 log d . Furthermore, this
method fails to recover the target sparse and rank-one matrix if n is dominated by k 2 . Estimation
of simultaneously structured matrices through convex relaxations similar to (5) is also studied in
[15] where it is shown that these methods do not attain optimal sample complexity. More recently,
assuming that the sparse target has a Bernoulli-Gaussian distribution, a generalized approximate
message passing framework is proposed in [16] to solve the CPR problem. Performance of this
method is evaluated through numerical simulations for standard Gaussian sensing matrices
 which
show the empirical phase transition for successful estimation occurs at n = O k log kd and also
the algorithms can have a significantly lower runtime compared to some of the competing algorithms including GESPAR [10] and CPRL [13]. The PhaseCode algorithm is proposed in [17] to
solve the CPR problem with sensing vectors designed using sparse graphs and techniques adapted
from coding theory. Although PhaseCode is shown to achieve the optimal sample complexity, it
lacks robustness guarantees.
While preparing the final version of the current paper, we became aware of [18] which has independently proposed an approach similar to ours to address the CPR problem.

Main Results
Algorithm

We propose a two-stage algorithm outlined in Algorithm 1. Each stage of the algorithm is a convex
program for which various efficient numerical solvers exists. In the first stage we solve (6) to obtain
b which is an estimator of the matrix
a low-rank matrix B
B? = Ψ X ?Ψ T.

b is used in the second stage of the algorithm as the measurements for a sparse estimation

Post-processing. The result of the low-rank estimation stage (6) is generally not rank-one. Simic that is k × k-sparse (i.e., it has
larly, the sparse estimation stage does not necessarily produce a X
at most k nonzero rows and columns) and rank-one. In fact, since we have not imposed the posic is not even guaranteed to be
tive semidefiniteness constraint (i.e., X < 0) in (7), the estimate X
positive semidefinite (PSD). However, we can enforce the rank-one or the sparsity structure in postprocessing steps simply by projecting the produced estimate on the set of rank-one or k × k-sparse
c onto the desired sets at
PSD matrices. The simple but important observation is that projecting X
most doubles the estimation error. This fact is shown by Lemma 2 in Section 4 in a general setting.
Alternatives. There are alternative convex relaxations for the low-rank estimation and the sparse
estimation stages of Algorithm (1). For example, (6) can be replaced by its regularized least squares
analog
b ∈ argmin 1 kW (B) − yk2 + λ kBk ,
B

for an appropriate choice of the regularization parameter λ. Similarly, instead of (7) we can use
an `1 -regularized least squares. Furthermore, to perform the low-rank estimation and the sparse
estimation we can use non-convex greedy type algorithms that typically have lower computational
costs. For example, the low-rank estimation stage can be performed via the Wirtinger flow method
proposed in [19]. Furthermore, various greedy compressive sensing algorithms such as the Iterative
Hard Thresholding [20] and CoSaMP [21] can be used to solve the desired sparse estimation. To
guarantee the accuracy of these compressive sensing algorithms, however, we might need to adjust
the assumption A2 to have the restricted isometry property for ck-sparse vectors with c being some
small positive integer.

Accuracy guarantees

The following theorem shows that any solution of the proposed algorithm is an accurate estimator
of X ? .
Theorem 1. Suppose that the assumptions A1, A2, and A3 hold with a sufficiently small constant
δ2k . Then, there exist positive absolute constants C1 , C2 , and C3 such that if
n ≥ C1 m,

for all rank-one and k × k-sparse matrices X ? < 0 with probability exceeding 1 − e−C3 n .
The proof of Theorem 1 is straightforward and is provided in Section 4. The main idea is first to
show the low-rank estimation stage produces an accurate estimate of B ? . Because this stage can
be viewed as a standard phase retrieval through lifting, we can simply use accuracy guarantees that
are already established in the literature (e.g., [3, 6, 5]). In particular, we use [5, Theorem 2] which
established an error bound that holds uniformly for all valid B ? . Thus we can ensure that X ? is
feasible in the sparse estimation stage. Then the accuracy of the sparse estimation stage can also be
established by a simple adaptation of the analyses based on the restricted isometry property such as
[22].
The dependence of n (i.e., the number of measurements) and k (i.e., the sparsity of the signal) is
not explicit in Theorem 1. This dependence is absorbed in m which must be sufficiently large for
Assumption A2 to hold. Considering a Gaussian matrix Ψ , the following corollary gives a concrete
example where the dependence of non k through m is exposed.
Corollary 1. Suppose that the assumptions of Theorem 1 including (8) hold. Furthermore, suppose
1
that Ψ is a Gaussian matrix with iid N 0, m
entries and

for all rank-one and k × k-sparse matrices X ? < 0 with probability exceeding 1 − 3e−c2 m for some



Proof. It is well-known that if Ψ has iid N 0, m
and we have (9) then (4) holds with high probability. For example, using a standard covering argument and a union bound [23] shows that if
(9) holds for a sufficiently large constant c1 > 0 then we have (4) for a sufficiently small constant δ2k with probability exceeding 1 − 2e−cm for some constant c > 0 that depends only
on δ2k . Therefore, Theorem 1 yields the desired result which holds with probability exceeding
1 − 2e−cm − e−C3 n ≥ 1 − 3e−c2 m for some constant c2 > 0 depending only on δ2k .

Numerical Experiments

We evaluated the performance of Algorithm 1 through some numerical simulations. The low-rank
estimation stage and the sparse estimation stage are implemented using the TFOCS package [24].
We considered the target k-sparse signal x? to be in R256 (i.e., d = 256). The support set of
of the target signal is selected uniformly at random and the entry values on this support are drawn
independently from N (0, 1). The noise vector z is also Gaussian with independent N 0, 10−4 . The
operator W and the matrix Ψ are drawn from some Gaussian ensembles as described in Corollary

with sparsity level (i.e., k) varying in the set {2, 4, 6, . . . , 20}.
In the first experiment, for each value of k, the pair (m, n) that determines the size W and Ψ are
selected from {(8k, 24k) , (8k, 32k) , (12k, 36k) , (12k, 48k) , (16k, 48k)}. Figure 1 illustrates the
0.9 quantiles of the relative error versus k for the mentioned choices of m.
In the second experiment we compared the performance of Algorithm 1 to the convex optimization
methods that do not exploit the structure of the sensing vectors. The setup for this experimentis the
same as in the first experiment except for the size of W and Ψ ; we chose m = 2k 1 + log kd and
n = 3m, where dre denotes the smallest integer greater than r. Figure 2 illustrates the 0.9 quantiles

which are denoted by 2-stage, SDP, SDP+`1 , and `1 , respectively. The SDP-based method did not
perform significantly different for other values of λ in our complementary simulations. The relative
error for each trial is also overlaid in Figure 2 visualize its empirical distribution. The empirical
performance of the algorithms are
 in agreement with the theoretical results. Namely in a regime
where n = O (m) = O k log kd , Algorithm 1 can produce accurate estimates whereas while the
other approaches fail in this regime. The SDP and SDP+`1 show nearly identical performance. The
`1 -minimization, however, competes with Algorithm 1 for small values of k. This observation
can be

with C = C20 , the target matrix X ? would be feasible in (7). Now, it suffices to show that the
sparse estimation stage can produce an accurate estimate of X ? . Recall that by A2, the matrix Ψ
is restricted isometry for 2k-sparse vectors. Let X be a matrix that is 2k × 2k-sparse, i.e., a matrix
whose entries except for some 2k × 2k submatrix are all zeros. Applying (4) to the columns of X
and adding the inequalities yield

Furthermore, let S0 ⊆ [d] × [d] denote the support set of the k × k-sparse target X . Define E 0 to
