In a departure from the organizational development literature, this study hypothesized that
managerial responses to organizational change are influenced by 7 dispositional traits (locus
of control, generalized self-efficacy, self-esteem, positive affectivity, openness to experience,
tolerance for ambiguity, and risk aversion). Data were collected from 6 organizations (N =
514) to test the hypotheses. The 7 traits were reduced to 2 factors: Positive Self-Concept and
Risk Tolerance. Both of these trait factors significantly predicted self-reports and independent
assessments of coping with change. Results also indicated that coping with organizational
change was related to extrinsic (salary, job level, plateauing, job performance) and intrinsic
(organizational commitment, job satisfaction) career outcomes and that coping mediated
roughly half of the relationships between the dispositional factors and these career outcomes.

In a recent review of the literature, Quinn, Kahn, and
Mandl (1994) noted that research in the field of organizational change and development has evolved from four major
paradigms: organizational development, strategic choice,
resource dependence-institutional theory, and population
ecology. That all four of these paradigms consider change at
the organizational level is a telling depiction of the organizational change literature. Research dealing with organizational change has been largely dominated by a macro,
systems-oriented focus. Some researchers have called for a
more micro, person-oriented focus pertaining to issues important in change (Bray, 1994), yet micro-level research on
organizational change remains limited. Studies of individual
behavior in relation to organizational change typically have

involved areas such as charismatic or transformational leadership, or the upper echelons perspective—focusing on the
role of top management in instituting change (Bantel &
Jackson, 1989; Hambrick & Mason, 1984; Wiersema &
Bantel, 1992). These studies aside, very little research has
taken a psychological focus in investigating the process of
organizational change. Neglected is the possibility that successful coping with change lies within the psychological
predispositions of individuals experiencing the change.
Accordingly, the goal of this study is to examine how
personality characteristics influence managerial coping with
organizational change. In this study, we focus on managers
from various levels of the organization who are most likely to
be affected by the change efforts. Of primary interest is the
prediction of managerial reactions to change as a function of
personality characteristics of the individuals experiencing the
changes. However, before the possible dispositional bases of
coping with change can be examined, the nature of coping with
organizational change needs to be understood. This process is
described in the following section.

Coping With Organizational Change
One central reaction to organizational change involves
the extent to which individual managers cope with the
uncertainties that radical change introduces into their work
lives. Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen, and DeLongis (1986) define coping as "the person's cognitive and behavioral efforts
to manage (reduce, minimize, or tolerate) the internal and
external demands of the person-environment transaction
that is appraised as taxing or exceeding the person's resources" (p. 572). Generally, research has shown problem107

focused coping strategies (dealing directly with the stressor)
to be more effective than emotion-focused strategies (focusing on the emotional changes brought on by the stressor;
Callan, 1993; Folkman et al., 1986).
It is well established that major organizational change is
viewed as a formidable stressor in organizational life, associated with negative outcomes such as job loss, reduced
status, conflict at work and home, and threats to the psychological well-being of the individual employee (Ashford,
1988; Schweiger & DeNisi, 1991). Lau and Woodman
(1995) argued that reactions to organizational change are
affected by the individual's change schemata, which they
defined as "mental map[s] representing knowledge structures of change attributes, and relationships among different
change events" (p. 538). Through qualitative and quantitative methods, these researchers noted significant relationships between such schemata and the reactions of individuals to change, and further found such schemata to be
significantly affected by personality.
Following this dispositional emphasis, we reviewed the
personality literature in search of the dispositional variables
most likely to be related to coping with change. On the basis
of this review, we identified seven personality variables:
locus of control, generalized self-efficacy, self-esteem, positive affectivity (PA), openness to experience, tolerance for
ambiguity, and risk aversion. These particular traits were
chosen on the basis of three criteria: (a) well-validated
measures of the traits existed; (b) construct validity evidence existed for these traits, and they had been used
successfully in previous research; and (c) there appeared to
be a theoretical relationship between the trait and coping
with change. These criteria led to the exclusion of some
potentially relevant constructs, such as hardiness and dispositional optimism, because of ongoing questions about
their construct validity (Hull, Van Treuren, & Virnelli,
1987; Smith, Pope, Rhodewalt, & Poulton, 1989). Through
our review was comprehensive, it is not intended to be
exhaustive, as there may be traits that met our three conditions that nevertheless were excluded from the study. Each
of the seven characteristics is discussed in turn, and hypothesized linkages between these traits and coping with change
are developed.
Dispositional Mechanisms Associated Coping With
Organizational Change
Locus of Control
Rotter (1966) proposed the concept of locus of control as
the perception by the individual of his or her ability to
exercise control over the environment. Those characterized
by an internal locus of control believe they have control
over their environment and their personal successes,
whereas those with an external locus of control view their

lives as controlled by external factors such as chance or
powerful others. Research is suggestive of a link between
locus of control and coping with organizational change.
Several studies have shown that internal locus of control is
associated with problem-focused coping strategies (Anderson, 1977; Callan, Terry, & Schweitzer, 1994), and individuals with an internal locus of control are less likely to suffer
the ill effects of stressors (Kobasa, 1979). Similarly, Newton and Keenan (1990) found that locus of control beliefs
significantly moderated the relationship between changes in
job demands and psychological strain over time. Two studies involving change support the trend of these findings.
Nelson, Cooper, and Jackson (1995) and Lau and Woodman
(1995) found that employees with internal loci of control
reported more positive attitudes in their organizations experiencing changes than employees with external loci of
control. Given the general pattern of associations between
locus of control and major life and work-related events, one
would except similar relationships between this construct
and individual differences in coping with organizational
change. Indeed, there is evidence for a robust relationship
between internal locus of control and individual adaptation
to change within work organizations (Callan et al., 1994;
Holahan & Moos, 1987; Kobasa, 1982).
Hypothesis 1: Internal locus of control positively relates to
coping with organizational change.

Generalized

Self-Efficacy

Bandura (1997) defined self-efficacy as "beliefs in one's
capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action
required to produce given attainments" (p. 3). According to
Bandura, self-efficacy is a generative capability in that it
enables individuals to integrate cognitive, social, emotional,
and behavioral subskills to accomplish a particular objective. Although self-efficacy was originally conceived of as
a task-specific variable, some researchers have shown support for the existence of a generalized self-efficacy disposition that predicts individual behavior across various situations and circumstances (Lennings, 1994; Sherer et al.,
1982; Tipton & Worthington, 1984). Generalized selfefficacy is often confused with locus of control. Selfefficacy differs from locus of control in that the former
involves the individual's perception that he or she possesses
the skills necessary to execute the required response set to
ensure a desired outcome, whereas the latter refers to
whether the consequences of such efforts are within the
person's control (Bandura, 1997). As noted by Judge,
Locke, and Durham (1997), this distinction is similar to the
one made in expectancy theory between expectancy (the
probability of being able to perform, which should correspond to self-efficacy) and instrumentality (the probability
of outcomes being linked to one's performance, which
should correspond to locus of control).

COPING WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

There are several mechanisms by which generalized selfefficacy may affect coping with change. First, the selfefficacy construct involves a generative "mobilization component" that allows for the adaptation of performance to
compliment the circumstances under which task execution
occurs (Gist & Mitchell, 1992). In addition, some researchers (Schunk, 1983) have noted that self-efficacy is particularly salient in situations that an individual may regard as
novel, unpredictable, or stressful. Several studies have revealed that self-efficacy is an important resource in dealing
with major career events such as career changes and job loss
(Chwalisz, Altmaier, & Russell, 1992; Holmes & Werbel,
1992; Stumpf, Brief, & Hartman, 1987). Finally, low efficacy levels have correlated with job withdrawal (McDonald
& Siegall, 1992) as well as "defensive behaviors," such as
resistance to change and protecting one's turf (Ashforth &
Lee, 1990). Results from all of these studies suggest that
high self-efficacy is a precursor for positive attitudes toward
critical career-oriented events, specifically those involving
major job and organizational changes.
Hypothesis 2: Self-efficacy positively relates to coping
with organizational change.

Self-Esteem
Coopersmith (1967) defined self-esteem as "the evaluation which the individual makes and customarily maintains
with regard to himself [expressing an attitude of] approval
or disapproval" and "the extent to which an individual
believes himself to be capable, significant, successful, and
worthy" (pp. 4-5). Self-esteem typically denotes a dispositional, global characteristic relevant to a holistic conception
of personal competence and worthiness. It also has been
described as a general approval of the self (Pierce, Gardner,
Cummings, & Dunham, 1989).
Research generally has found self-esteem to be a relevant
variable in the measurement of workplace attitudes and
behaviors. High self-esteem correlates positively with job
satisfaction (Adler, 1980), reemployment after involuntary
job loss (Kinicki, 1989), and successful job search outcomes
(Jalajas, 1994). In addition, several studies have focused
specifically on the relationship between self-esteem and
organizational change. Folkman et al. (1986) noted a direct
effect of self-esteem on adaptation to change on the part of
employees. Ashford (1988) studied the reactions of employees after the transformation of the Bell Telephone system,
and discovered a negative correlation between self-esteem
and stress levels. In the same study, self-esteem also predicted positive scores on a measure of perceived change
efficacy of individual employees. Similarly, Callan et al.
(1994) recently found significant, negative associations between self-esteem and levels of stress, anxiety, and depression among a sample of attorneys who had perceived a high
degree of change within their respective firms. General

109

trends in the findings relating self-esteem to work behaviors
and attitudes suggest a positive relationship between selfesteem and coping with organizational change.
Hypothesis 3: Self-esteem positively relates to coping with
organizational change.

Positive Affectivity
PA represents an underlying personality disposition typically manifested in characteristics such as well-being, confidence, energy, gregariousness, and affiliation. In general,
it is associated with a positive worldview. Though scant
research has focused on associations between PA and coping reactions to organizational change, several aspects of the
PA construct suggest that individuals high in PA should be
amenable to organizational change. Holahan and Moos
(1987) found confidence and an easygoing manner to be
predictive of effective coping with life events. As selfconfidence and calmness represent major facets of the PA
construct, it is expected that high-PA managers would exhibit more positive coping strategies in the face of an
organizational change as well. In fact, Bowman and Stern
(1995) discovered a significant positive correlation between
PA and the utilization of problem-focused coping during
stressful occupational episodes. In addition, the aspect of
PA dealing with gregariousness and affiliation should aid
individuals in forming positive relationships with coworkers
and others. These relationships could function as a buffering
mechanism to aid in coping with the adverse effects of
stress associated with such a change (Cohen & Wills, 1985).
Empirical research supports this effect, insofar as the availability of work-related support from a supervisor has been
found to ameliorate the impact of stresses associated with
role conflict and role overload (Terry, Nielsen, & Perchard,
1994). Finally, Watson and Clark (1997) have noted that the
PA construct reflects individual differences in boldness and
adventurousness, whereby "high scorers desire change and
variety in their lives, and become bored or dissatisfied when
[change] is absent" and tend to "seek out intense, stimulating environments" (p. 776). Thus, high-PA managers
should be more likely to cope with changes from which they
derive a sense of satisfaction.
Hypothesis 4: PA positively relates to coping with organizational change.

Openness to Experience
Openness to experience represents the fifth of the Big
Five personality dimensions. Although there has been some
disagreement as to the exact definition of openness (Peabody & Goldberg, 1989), it is generally associated with
intelligence, perceptiveness, creativity, imagination, tolerance, culturedness, and inquisitiveness (Goldberg, 1992).
Several studies have related openness to experience to ef-

JUDGE, THORESEN, PUCIK, AND WELBOURNE

fective coping and adjustment. McCrae and Costa (1986)
found that openness (measured by both self- and peer report) was positively related to the utilization of effective
coping strategies in dealing with stressful life events. In
turn, these coping strategies positively affected overall life
satisfaction. Whitbourne (1986) extended these findings to
the specific realm of the workplace, noting that openness to
experience was positively associated with identity flexibility in work as well as family roles. Given the tendencies of
individuals high on openness to be tolerant and inquisitive
when confronted with novel situations (as well as to actively
seek out such situations), they should be less likely to
perceive change as stressful, and cope more effectively with
organizational change.
Hypothesis 5: Openness to experience positively relates to
coping with organizational change.

Tolerance for Ambiguity
Budner (1962) defined tolerance for ambiguity as "the
tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable,"
whereas the intolerance of ambiguity refers to "the tendency
to perceive (i.e., interpret) ambiguous situations as sources
of threat" (p. 29). One of the first empirical investigations of
the construct found tolerance for ambiguity to be associated
with the willingness of persons to change their opinions on
matters, as well as tolerate and cope with new experiences
(Rydell, 1966). Much of the research on tolerance for ambiguity has focused on the relationship between tolerance
for ambiguity and work-related anxiety and strain. For example, Keenan and McBain (1979) found a positive relationship between role ambiguity and psychological strain
among midlevel managers who were low in tolerance for
ambiguity. Similarly, a study investigating the effects of
ambiguity tolerance on anxiety levels prior to a job interview found a negative correlation between tolerance for
ambiguity and anxiety levels (Keenan, 1978). Given the
uncertainty typically involved in organizational change efforts, as well as the stress typically associated with such
changes, the tolerance for ambiguity construct should be
useful in describing coping reactions to such changes. Several studies support this inference. In a sample of Bell
Telephone system employees, Ashford (1988) found that
tolerance for ambiguity was related to several aspects of
coping with the changes induced by AT&T's divestiture.
Rush, Schoel, and Barnard (1995) found that items assessing tolerance for ambiguity were correlated with several
aspects of coping with change among state government
employees. Finally, a study involving organizational development consultants in the U.S. Navy identified comfort with
ambiguity as a characteristic of successful change agents
(Hamilton, 1988).
Hypothesis 6: Tolerance for ambiguity positively relates to
coping with organizational change.

Risk Aversion
The propensity of individuals to seek out or avoid risky
scenarios has typically been seen as entirely situational
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), and little research has entertained the hypothesis that predisposition toward risk-taking
is an individual difference variable. The closest approximation to a dispositional theory of risk aversion stems from the
research of Lopes (1994). Lopes has theorized that risk
aversion is a function of differential attention to various
stimuli in risky situations. Specifically, risk aversion is
associated with a security orientation on the part of the
decision maker, as opposed to seeing risk in terms of
potential gains. Other research has identified a positive
correlation between the perception of risk and various measures of anxiety (Schaninger, 1976). However, little research has considered risk aversion as an individual difference. Maehr and Videbeck (1968) measured risk aversion
across subjects and reported that individuals who were
averse to risk avoided taking chances and tended to be
unhappy in situations where risk was salient. Because organizational change efforts often involve increased risk,
managers who are averse to such risk should cope less well
with these changes. In fact, several studies considering risk
aversion as an individual difference have found that individuals who are averse to risk view novel and risk-oriented
situations negatively and seek to withdraw from such situations (Cable & Judge, 1994; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin,
1989). Thus, although no research has considered how a risk
aversion predisposition may pose difficulties in dealing with
organizational change, several studies are suggestive of
such a linkage.
Hypothesis 7: Risk aversion negatively relates to coping
with organizational change.

Links Between Coping With Change and
Career Outcomes
In order to be practically important, coping with change
must be related to variables that are psychologically meaningful and important to individuals and organizations.
Given the degree of change experienced in the organizations
under study (see Method section), we believed successful
coping with change was likely to be manifested in a number
of ways. First, individuals who can successfully cope in an
organization undergoing high degrees of change should be
more satisfied and committed to the organization. Recent
work by Wanberg and Banas (1997) found that general
attitudes toward change, change acceptance, and positive
views of organizational change were positively related to
job satisfaction. Negative attitudes toward change have also
been associated with lower job satisfaction and commitment
(Schweiger & DeNisi, 1991), and stress-job dissatisfaction
relationships following organizational change have been

COPING WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

found to be higher for employees lower in organizational
commitment (Begley & Czajka, 1993). Thus, we believed
that coping with change would be positively related to job
satisfaction and organizational commitment.
Second, successful coping with change is likely to be
perceived as important to transforming organizations. As a
result, those who cope well with change should receive
higher performance ratings and achieve higher levels of
extrinsic career success. Judge, Cable, Boudreau, and Bretz
(1995) considered extrinsic success in terms of salary and
ascendancy. Ascendancy consists not only of previous
movement up the organizational hierarchy (job level) but
also of prospective movement, such as is not the case when
executives perceive that they are plateaued in their organization (Chao, 1990). Although no research that we are
aware of has investigated the relationship between coping
with change and extrinsic success directly, Callan et al.
(1994) found that ineffective (emotion-focused) copers
were more anxiety prone following organizational change,
suggesting that they would most likely be less effective in
their jobs as well. Further, the hypothesized relationships
between the dispositional traits and coping with change, and
between coping with change and career outcomes, lead to
the expectation that coping will mediate (at least in part) the
relationship between the traits and career outcomes.
Hypothesis 8: Coping successfully with organizational
change is positively related to the following career outcomes:
(a) job satisfaction, (b) organizational commitment, (c) extrinsic career outcomes (salary, ascendancy), and (d) job
performance.
Hypothesis 9: Coping successfully with organizational
change partly mediates the relationship between personality
and the following career outcomes: (a) job satisfaction, (b)
organizational commitment, (c) extrinsic career outcomes
(salary, ascendancy), and (d) job performance.
Method
Setting, Participants, and Procedure
Participants in the current study were employed by six organizations headquartered in four different continents (North America,
Europe, Asia, and Australia). The organizations included two large
European companies (a shipping company headquartered in Scandinavia and an oil company headquartered in the United Kingdom); two Australian banks (of which one was among the largest
banks in Australia and another was a medium-sized bank); a large
American university; and a large, private Korean manufacturing
company. Upper management confirmed that each of these organizations had experienced recent large-scale changes, including
major reorganization efforts and downsizing, changes in top management, mergers and acquisitions, and business divestments.
Across all organizations, 73% of the managers agreed with the
statement, "The changes that are being made will impact all parts
of our work" (standard deviation across organizations = 5%),
whereas 78% disagreed with the statement, "The changes that are
being made are fairly limited" (standard deviation across organi-

111

zations = 7%). Thus, although we are confident that managers in
these organizations were experiencing a high degree of change, the
specific types of changes occurring in each organization were not
essential to our study (i.e., we were not attempting to predict how
managerial responses to change vary as a function of the type of
change). Rather, that high degrees of change were occurring in
these organizations merely provides a useful context for studying
the predictors and outcomes of coping with change.
Surveys were sent via internal mail to middle- and upper-level
management personnel in various business functions in each of the
six organizations. Each company was asked to identify a random
sample of managers who would serve as participants. A cover
letter that accompanied the survey explained the purpose of the
study and promised respondents that their responses were completely confidential. All surveys were written in English, with the
exception of those completed by participants in the Korean company. Because of within-company differences in English proficiency, an individual from the company translated the survey into
Korean. The survey was then back-translated into English by a
translator affiliated with the University of Iowa. In order to obtain
an independent assessment of how well respondents coped with
change, a one-page assessment of the respondents' coping ability
and job performance was sent to each respondent's boss, subordinate, or peer. The company determined who would serve as the
independent assessor. The independent assessor was instructed to
complete the survey away from the person being assessed and to
return the assessment to an organizational contact in an enclosed
envelope. This contact person then forwarded the assessments
unopened to the authors.
In total, 720 surveys were distributed, which included 305 at the
Korean company, 115 at the British company, 100 each at the
Scandinavian company and the American university, and 50 each
at the large and small Australian banks. A total of 514 matched sets
of surveys were returned (self-report surveys that could be
matched to independent assessments), for an overall response rate
of 71%. The number of respondents in each of the organizations
was as follows: Korean company (n = 276), British company (n =
58), large Australian bank (n = 32), small Australian bank (n =
37), Scandinavian company (n = 72), and American university
(n = 39). The average age of respondents was 41.8 years. A total
of 91% of the respondents were male, and 92% were married.
Although no formal comparisons of respondents and nonrespondents were made, it appeared from the descriptive statistics (see
Results section) that those who returned surveys were representative of the larger population. Approximately 76% of the independent assessments (n = 392) were returned by immediate supervisors of the participants, whereas 18% (n = 91) and 6% (n = 31)
were returned by peers and subordinates, respectively.
Measures
The scales described below were originally developed using
various response formats. For example, one measure was developed with a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree), another measure used a 4-point scale ranging
from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree), and one measure
used a 6-point scale ranging from —3 (strongly disagree) to +3
(strongly agree) with no middle anchor. In order to avoid confusing the respondents, all measures (unless otherwise noted) used a

JUDGE, THORESEN, PUCIK, AND WELBOURNE

5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5' (strongly
agree). Research has suggested that these sorts of relatively minor
alterations to questionnaire response formats do not affect their
validity (Matell & Jacoby, 1971).
Locus of control. Levenson's (1981) Internality scale, like
Rotter's (1966) original scale, assesses the degree to which people
believe they have control over their own lives (internal locus of
control). However, Levenson's measure avoids some of the problems of Rotter's scale (e.g., inherent social desirability bias,
forced-choice response format; Lefcourt, 1991). Levenson's internality measure exhibits moderate reliabilities and has been used in
a wide variety of samples (see Levenson, 1981). Example items
from the Internality scale include, "Whether or not I get to be a
leader depends mostly on my ability," "I can pretty much determine what will happen in my life," and "My life is determined by
my own actions." In the present study, the reliability (a) of the
10-item scale was .66.
Generalized self-efficacy.
Generalized self-efficacy was measured by a 10-item scale that combined items from Jones (1986)
and Sherer et al. (1982). Example statements include, "When I
make plans, I am certain to make them work" and "I can learn
almost anything if I set my mind to it." The reliability of this scale
was .75.
Self-esteem. Self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg's
(1965) 10-item scale. This scale is the most common measure of
self-esteem, and considerable empirical data support its validity
(Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991). Example items include, "On the
whole, I am satisfied with myself and "I feel that I am a person
of importance, at least on an equal basis with others." In the
present study, the reliability of this scale was .78.
Positive affectivity.
We measured PA with the PA portion of the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark, &
Tellegen, 1988), a 10-item measure of an individual's tendency to
experience positive emotional states. As recommended by Watson et
al. (1988), we measured trait-PA by using long-term instructions.
Watson et al. reported that the PANAS displayed high degrees of
reliability and convergent and discriminant validity. Furthermore,
Watson et al. reported that the PA Schedule was very stable over time.
For the PA Schedule in the present study, a = .82.
Openness to experience. Openness to experience was measured with the 12-item Openness to Experience subscale from the
NEO—Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (Costa & McCrae,
1992).' The NEO is the most widely used measure of the Big Five
personality characteristics, and substantial evidence exists for the
stability and validity of the NEO. Example items include, "I have
little interest in speculating on the nature of the universe of the
human condition," and "Sometimes when I am reading poetry or
looking at a work of art, I feel a chill or wave of excitement." In
the present study, the reliability of the openness scale was .68.
Tolerance for ambiguity. The present study used three scales
to measure tolerance for ambiguity. First, the seven-item Tolerance for Ambiguity Scale developed by Lorsch and Morse (1974)
and adapted by Gupta and Govindarajan (1984) was used. Second,
consistent with other research (Ashford, & Cummings 1985),
Norton's (1975) Ambiguity Tolerance Scale also was used. Finally, McLain's (1993) Tolerance for Ambiguity Scale was used.
Example items from these scales include, "I do not like to get
started in group projects unless I feel assured that the project will

be successful," "I function poorly whenever there is a serious lack
of communication in a job situation," and "When planning a
vacation, a person should have a schedule to follow if he or she is
really going to enjoy it." The reliability of this composite 18-item
scale was .73.
Risk aversion. Risk aversion was measured using the scale
developed by Cable and Judge (1994), based on original scales
developed by Slovic (1972) and Gomez-Mejia and Balkin (1989).
Example items include, "I am not willing to take risks when
choosing a job or a company to work for" and "I view risk of a job
as a situation to be avoided at all costs." The reliability of this
eight-item scale was .76.
Coping with organizational change. Because no measure of
managerial coping with change could be found in the literature,
coping was measured by a scale originally developed by the
authors. A large pool of items was generated from a review of the
change literature. These items were then administered to several
samples of managers in the United States and Singapore. The
larger pool of items was reduced on the basis of results from a
principal-components analysis and examination of item-total correlations. The resulting 12-item scale, labeled the Coping With
Organizational Change Scale (developed in 1998 by Timothy A.
Judge and Vladimir Pucik) measures coping with change by considering both reactance to change and leading change. Because the
original principal-components analysis suggested that the 12-items
loaded on a single dimension, we estimated a confirmatory factor
analysis to assess goodness of fit. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we constrained the 12 items to load on a single factor.
LISREL results indicated that the single factor solution fit the data
well, both for self-reports, ^(54, N = 514) = 158.64, p < .01;
goodness-of-fit index = .93; comparative fit index = .94, and for
the independent assessments, x*(54, N = 514) = 196.65, p < .01;
goodness-of-fit index = .94; comparative fit index = .91. The
scale items and factor loadings for each item are provided in the
Appendix. To form an overall measure of coping with change, we
summed the 12 items to form a single scale for the self-report and
independent assessment data sources. The reliability (a) of this
scale was .77 for self-reports and .79 for the independent
assessment.
Extrinsic career outcomes. Consistent with past research (e.g.,
Judge et al., 1995), extrinsic career outcomes were conceptualized
as consisting of pay (i.e., salary) and ascendancy (i.e., job level).
Respondents were asked to report their annual salary and, consistent with Judge et al. (1995), the number of levels their job was
below the CEO in their organization. Because respondents were
employed in various countries, all salaries were converted to U.S.
dollars using 90-day forward exchange rates from May 1995. A
one-way analysis of variance (Salary X Currency) indicated large
differences in salary (expressed in U.S. dollars) as a function of
currency, F(5, 508) = 34.54; if = .25; p < .001. To control for

COPING WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE
salary differences as a function of differing price levels across
countries where participants were employed, we converted salaries
to z scores (by currency). Finally, Chao's (1990) two-item measure
of plateauing ("I do not feel like I am getting ahead anymore in my
company"; a = .61) was used.
Organizational commitment. Organizational commitment was
measured with the nine-item Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, the most widely used measure of commitment (Mathieu
& Zajac, 1990). In the questionnaire respondents are asked to
indicate their agreement with nine items that are a mix of attitudes
("I really care about the fate of this organization") and behavioral
intentions ("I would accept almost any type of job assignment in
order to keep working for this organization"). The reliability of this
scale was .79.
Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured with the Overall Job Satisfaction Scale used by Judge, Boudreau, and Bretz
(1994). This three-item measure was partly based on Scarpello and
Campbell's (1983) review and consists of the Gallup poll measure
of job satisfaction, the nongraphic version of the G. M. Faces
Scale, and an adapted version of the Fordyce Percent Time Happy
Item. Because the items were measured with different scales, they
were standardized prior to computation of the composite measure.
The standardized coefficient alpha reliability of the three-item
composite was .78.
Performance rating. Overall job performance was assessed
with a single-item measure completed by the independent assessor
(as was noted earlier, in 76% of the cases this was the supervisor).
The independent assessor was asked to respond to the statement,
"This person's overall level of job performance is above average
for his/her work group." Although perhaps not ideal given the
nature of the statement, to preserve consistency in response scales,
the assessor responded with the same 5-point scale (1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree) as with the coping items.

Results
Descriptive Information Regarding Study Variables
Table 1 shows mean comparisons across all six organizations on variables of interest to the current study.
One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with pairedcomparison contrasts were conducted to examine possible
differences in these variables across the organizations studied. Because of the large sample size of the study, many of
these comparisons reached statistical significance. However, the absolute magnitude of these differences (particularly for the dispositional variables) was typically not large.
One exception was locus of control, where the means
ranged from 3.14 (British company) to 3.85 (Korean company)—roughly a 14% difference. Several of the career
outcome variables displayed considerably more variability.
Salary (converted to z scores by currency in subsequent
analyses) displayed substantial variability, ranging from
$43,218 (Korean company) to $118,650 (Scandinavian
company). These differences were likely a function of differences in price levels between countries and, perhaps,
national living standards and organizational differences.

113

Number of levels below the chief executive officer of the
organization (ranging from 2.40 in the Scandinavian company to 4.88 in the large Australian bank) and career plateauing (varying from 2.20 in the Scandinavian company
to 3.23 in the American university) also varied widely.
Because the jobs held by respondents were generally quite
similar across organizations, these differences were likely
due to differences in company size and structure. That these
outcomes are so variable made it important to investigate
the generalizability of the variables across countries.
Though not reported in Table 1, we also analyzed
whether there were significant differences in the independent assessment of coping as a function of rating source
(supervisor, peer, or subordinate ratings). A one-way
ANOVA revealed that assessments of coping with change
differed as a function of source, F(2, 511) = 9.44, -r/2 = .04,
p < .001. Pairwise comparisons revealed that peers supplied
significantly more severe ratings than supervisors of subordinates. However, the absolute magnitude of these differences was not large (72% of the maximum possible score
for peer ratings; 76% for both supervisory and subordinate
ratings). In addition, there was no evidence of leniency bias
when self-assessments of coping were compared to independent assessments, paired samples ?(513) = —0.14, ns.
Because there was some evidence of mean differences in
ratings by rating source, we discuss the implications of
controlling for rating source in a subsequent section of this
article.

Correlations Among Study Variables
Correlations among the study variables are provided in
Table 2. Two sets of correlations are provided. Uncorrected
correlations are provided above the diagonal, and metaanalyzed correlations, corrected for sampling and measurement error, are provided below the diagonal. We included
meta-analytic estimates of the relationships among the variables for several reasons. First, meta-analysis allowed us to
determine whether correlations between dispositional variables and career outcome measures were situationally specific (in other words, whether correlations between dispositions and outcome variables truly differed across
organizations). Given that six organizations, located in four
different continents, were represented in this study, this was
an important advantage. Second, it was desirable to analyze
the data using the best possible estimates of true score
relationships. We used meta-analysis to estimate the true
score relationships among constructs by correcting estimates for sampling and measurement error. Accordingly,
the correlation matrix of dispositional and career outcome
variables was meta-analyzed following the procedures outlined by Hunter and Schmidt (1990).
The meta-analytic results are presented in the lower diagonal in Table 2. In order to address the issue of situational

specificity, we conducted a second-order sampling error
analysis (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990) of all bivariate relationships. In order to refute the situational specificity hypothesis, the mean percent variance accounted for by statistical
artifacts averaged across all possible bivariate relationships
should equal or exceed 100% (for a more thorough explanation of second-order sampling error analysis, see Hunter
& Schmidt, 1990, pp. 421-422). Results indicated that the
mean percent variance accounted for exceeded 100% when

all bivariate correlations were considered, as well as when
only relationships between dispositions and outcome variables were examined. These results supported the conclusion that situational specificity did not affect true score
estimates of correlations in these data. Relationships between variables of interest in this study did not truly differ
and were generalizable across the six organizations.
The pattern of correlations reported in Table 2 merits
some discussion. First, it is necessary to note the variable,

yet generally moderate to high, intercorrelations among the
dispositional variables. (Also included in Table 2 are two
factors—Positive Self-Concept and Risk Tolerance—which
were composed of a combination of the seven dispositional
traits. These are discussed below.) For both the uncorrected
and meta-analyzed correlations, all of the personality traits
displayed significant correlations with both self-reports and
independent assessments of coping with change. In addition, the rank ordering of dispositions as predictors of coping was quite similar across both sources of assessments (in
particular, PA and tolerance for ambiguity were the strongest correlates of coping for both data sources). The significant correlations between the seven dispositional traits and
both measures of coping provided support for Hypotheses
1-7. In terms of relationships with career outcomes, coping
with change was most strongly associated with career plateauing, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction.
The correlation between independent assessments of coping
with change and ratings of job performance was relatively
strong, perhaps reflecting halo effects on the part of the
rater. In general, coping was significantly correlated with
career outcomes, regardless of rating source.

Principal-Components Analysis of Dispositional
Traits
Because of the high intercorrelations among dispositional
variables shown in Table 2, we conducted a principalcomponents analysis (varimax rotation) of the seven primary dispositions to determine whether these dispositions
could be explained by a smaller number of common factors.
Results of the principal-components analysis are shown in
Table 3. A two-factor solution emerged from this analysis.

Factor 1 (comprised of locus of control, generalized selfefficacy, self-esteem, and PA) explained 60% of the shared
variance in the dispositional constructs. Openness to experience, tolerance for ambiguity, and risk aversion loaded
primarily on Factor 2 (which explained 17% of the shared
variance). PA loaded on both factors, but because it loaded
most highly on Factor 1, we treated it as a manifestation of
that factor. Factor 1 was labeled Positive Self-Concept in a
manner consistent with Judge et al. (1997), who argued that
individual success in organizations is largely determined by
a person's "core evaluations" of the self along dimensions
such as those captured by these four dispositional variables.
Because the dispositions that loaded highly on the second
factor pertained to the ability to deal with uncertainty, novel
situations, and risk, this factor was labeled Risk Tolerance

reflecting a low level of risk aversion). These two factors
explained 76% of the shared variance in the personality
constructs of interest. Factor scores were saved from this
analysis and used in subsequent analyses.

Regression of Coping With Change on
Personality Dispositions
On the basis of the results of the principal-components
analysis, self- and independent assessments of coping with
change were regressed on the two dispositional factor scores
resulting from the principal-components analysis described
above. These regressions were performed using the multiple
regression program REGRESS (Hunter, 1992) to avoid
some of the problems associated with unreliability of predictors and outcome variables described earlier. Results for
these regressions are shown in Table 4. The two trait factors
explained a statistically significant amount of variance in
coping with change, regardless of which coping source was
considered. Not surprisingly, the percent variance accounted for was higher for predictions of self-reports of
coping (R2 = .69, p < .01) than for independent assessments (R2 = .16, p < .01). These results suggested that the
two traits were significantly related to coping with organizational change, regardless of the source of the coping
assessment.
Impact of Rating Source
As was noted earlier, the three sources of the independent
assessment of coping differed in their mean evaluation, with
peers being less favorable in their ratings than supervisors
or subordinates. To investigate the degree to which these
differences may have influenced the results, we included
two dummy variables representing supervisors and peers as
the source of data (subordinates served as the excluded
group) in the regression predicting the independent assess-

ment of coping from the personality factors. Though the
peer variable was statistically significant, indicating that
peers were more severe in their evaluations, including these
variables had a trivial effect on the effect of the personality
variables on coping (the )3 coefficients changed .000 and
.002 from the regressions in Table 4). Furthermore, when
interaction terms were formed between the rating source
dummy variables and the personality factors, the interactions were not significant. Thus, it did not appear that source
of the independent assessment moderated the effect of the
personality factors on coping.
Relationships of Traits and Coping to
Career Outcomes
To test Hypothesis 8 (coping is related to career outcomes) and Hypothesis 9 (coping partly mediates the relationship between coping and career outcomes), we estimated a series of hierarchical regressions. To test
Hypothesis 8, we regressed the career outcomes on the
coping measures. To test Hypothesis 9, we performed a
mediated regression analysis as described by Cohen and
Cohen (1983). There are three requirements that must be
satisfied for mediation to be present. First, the dispositional
factors must be related to the career outcome variables (i.e.,
there must be an effect to mediate). Second, coping with
change must be related to the career outcomes. Finally, the
relationship between the dispositional traits and the career
outcome variables must be reduced after adjusting for the
effects of coping with change. The percent effect mediated
was calculated by dividing (a) the incremental variance
explained by the traits after controlling for coping by (b) the
total variance explained by the traits when entered into the
regressions alone, and then subtracting this proportion
from 1.0.
Tables 5 and 6 provide results of regressions linking
coping, traits, and coping and traits combined to the career

outcomes. With respect to the relationship between coping
and career outcomes (Hypothesis 8), the regression results
revealed that both assessments of coping with change explained significant variance in all career outcomes. With
respect to coping mediating the relationship between the
traits and outcomes (Hypothesis 9), the first two requirements of mediation were clearly satisfied. Specifically,
when entered into the regression equations alone, the dispositional traits explained significant variance in the career
outcomes, with the exception of job level. Similarly, as was
noted above, when entered into the regressions alone, coping with organizational change explained significant variance in the career outcomes. Although the first two requirements for mediation were generally satisfied, the last
requirement supported the hypothesis of partial mediation.
Specifically, in most cases when the traits alone explained
significance variance in career outcomes, they also explained significant incremental variance when controlling

for coping. In two cases (job level and job performance with
the independent assessment) suppressor effects were observed, indicating that the traits explained more variance
controlling for coping. When one looks at the |3 coefficients
in Tables 5 and 6, there are a number of cases in which
significant trait coefficients became nonsignificant when
coping was controlled. On average, coping mediated 50% of
the relationship between the traits and career outcomes.
Thus, Hypothesis 8 appeared to be supported by the results.
Discussion
The present study represents a departure from the literature on organizational change that has generally taken a
systems or structural approach to effecting organizational
change. Because the success of change efforts lies in the
abilities and motivation of individuals within the organization, an individual-level approach to managing change

seems appropriate. Indeed, the results supported this
individual-level effort in identifying seven dispositional
constructs that were, to varying degrees, related to successful coping with organizational change. The strongest and
most consistent dispositional variables, in terms of their
relationship to coping with change, were tolerance for ambiguity and PA. The other traits were strongly correlated
with self-reports of coping with change but displayed appreciably weaker (though still statistically significant) associations with the independent assessments of coping. Because all seven traits showed significant correlations with
the independent assessment, common method variance does
not seem to be a viable alternative explanation of the results.
The results also revealed that the dispositional constructs
included in this study were related and, in fact, comprised
two independent factors. These factors were labeled Positive Self-Concept and Risk Tolerance. The Positive SelfConcept factor was composed of locus of control, PA,
self-esteem, and self-efficacy. The Risk Tolerance factor
was composed of openness to experience, low risk aversion,
and tolerance for ambiguity. Both factors were positively
related to coping with change for self-reports, as well as
independent assessments of coping with change.
Results further revealed that the dispositional factors
were related to both intrinsic (job satisfaction, organizational commitment) and extrinsic (salary, career plateau,
and job performance) dimensions of career success. Coping
with change, through its relationship to the traits and career
outcomes, mediated some of the relationships between the
traits and career outcomes. The tendency of mediation effects to be stronger when self-reports were considered could
be a function of common method variance, as, for this
analysis, the traits, coping, and outcomes were measured
with the same survey. Although the degree of mediation
varied depending on whether the self- or independent assessment of coping was used, but sets of results suggested
that Positive Self-Concept and Risk Tolerance are related to
career success. This finding is partially explained by the
tendency of managers scoring high on the traits and measures of career success to be viewed as more effective at
coping with organizational change.
The results of this study fit well with the emerging body
of research indicating that many behaviors and attitudes are
dispositionally based (at least in part). In the past decade of
organizational behavior research, personality characteristics
have been linked to leadership, job attitudes, job stress, and
work performance (House, Shane, & Herold, 1996). One
continuing area for development, however, is to link dispositional variables to important work behaviors. Because
successful coping with change is one such behavior, one of
the potential contributions of this study is to the dispositional perspective in organizations.
Several implications for research and for practice are
apparent from the results. Although the predominant macro

approach to organizational change is not inappropriate, it is
important to remember that most change interventions fail
(Porras & Robertson, 1992). Thus, there is considerable
room for improving the effectiveness of change efforts. The
results of this study suggest that one source of making
change efforts more successful lies in the characteristics of
the individual manager. Further research is required to demonstrate how organizations could implement these findings
to facilitate change management efforts. A potential application, however, lies in the assessment and selection of
managers. As with the literature on expatriate assignments,
selecting managers on the basis of their dispositional
make-up may be warranted. Thus, in considering managers
for change-oriented assignments, this study suggests that
organizations might want to consider managers who have a
positive self-concept and are risk tolerant. Supporting the
selection implications of the dispositional concepts is the
finding that both constructs were significant predictors of
job performance (see Table 5). Of course, no trait is universally desirable. For example, an organization that hires
no risk-adverse employees may soon gamble away its fortune. Positive Self-Concept and Risk Tolerance are only
two of many factors that organizations may wish to
consider.
Furthermore, before organizations actually begin selecting managers on the basis of these characteristics, more
research is required in several areas. First, although there is
an extensive body of literature supporting the reliability and
validity of the dispositions included in this study, few of
these characteristics have been studied in a selection context. Thus, although the results of the present study are
suggestive, they do not directly demonstrate the validity of
these dispositions in managerial selection. Second, responses to personality inventories are subject to social desirability biases because most questions are relatively transparent (i.e., it is often apparent what qualifies as a "good"
answer). Although it is far from clear that faking is a
problem with the use of personality measures in selection
(Barrick & Mount, 1996), the falsifying potential of measures of positive self-concept and risk tolerance should be
investigated in actual selection settings.
Another important practical concern in considering the
selection implications of our results is the issue of whether
the traits that predict job performance during periods of high
change would also predict job performance during periods
of less change. Although there is little evidence that the
traits making up the Risk Tolerance factor predict typical
job performance, the major element of Positive Self-Concept—self-esteem—does appear to display nonzero correlations with job performance (Pierce et al., 1989). Thus, at
least with respect to one of the dispositional factors included
in this study, selection with the goal of enhancing coping
during high change periods may also lead to higher job
performance levels during periods of lesser change.

COPING WITH ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE

Although the selection implications of these results are
intriguing, organizations often have limited flexibility in
selecting or placing managers in change-oriented assignments. Because organizations facing major changes must
deal with the managers who are already in place, it would be
preferable for organizations to be able to develop managers
to cope with change more effectively. Does the efficacy of
the dispositions considered in this study preclude successful
developmental change management programs? Not necessarily. Although core personality traits such as the Big Five
are quite stable over time and appear to have a genetic basis
(Costa & McCrae, 1992; Goldberg, 1992; Jang, Vesley, &
Vernon, 1996), other dispositional characteristics may be
more malleable. Research indicates that whereas there is
substantial stability in core personality characteristics such
as the Big Five, intrapsychic dispositional characteristics
that relate to coping styles seem to be more subject to
change (Lachman, 1989). In fact, Caspi and Bern (1990)
noted that some traits, such as the Big Five, tend to show
high stability over time whereas other traits, such as selfesteem, show less stability, with correlations' between .20
and .40 over 5- to 10-year intervals. Thus, it appears that
some traits included in our study, for example, self-esteem,
are more malleable than others, such as openness to experience. This suggests that positive self-concept may be
easier to change than risk tolerance. But how might this be
brought about? Bandura (1997) discussed four ways in
which task-specific self-efficacy can be enhanced: enactive
mastery experiences, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and feedback. Whether organizations should be concerned with using such techniques toward the goal of changing employees' self-concept and whether such efforts would
be successful are worthy topics for future researchers to
consider.
A limitation of the present study is that only a subset of
all possible dispositions that may affect coping with organizational change were included in this study. For example,
hardiness has been related to coping with change among
public sector employees (Rush et al., 1995), and constructive thinking has been found to lead to more productive
strategies in coping with stressful life events (Epstein,
1992). Future research should expand the dispositions studied to determine whether they add incremental variance
beyond those included in the present study.
