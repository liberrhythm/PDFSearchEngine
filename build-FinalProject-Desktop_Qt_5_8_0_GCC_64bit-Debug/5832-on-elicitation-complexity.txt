Abstract
Elicitation is the study of statistics or properties which are computable via empirical risk minimization. While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong
question—all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or
data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable. Specifically, what is
the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property?
Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity
and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation. We establish several general
results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity. These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a
large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new
properties of interest.

Introduction

Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a domininant framework for supervised machine learning,
and a key component of many learning algorithms. A statistic or property is simply a functional
assigning a vector of values to each distribution. We say that such a property is elicitable, if for
some loss function it can be represented as the unique minimizer of the expected loss under the
distribution. Thus, the study of which properties are elicitable can be viewed as the study of which
statistics are computable via ERM [1, 2, 3].
The study of property elicitation began in statistics [4, 5, 6, 7], and is gaining momentum in machine
learning [8, 1, 2, 3], economics [9, 10], and most recently, finance [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. A sequence of
papers starting with Savage [4] has looked at the full characterization of losses which elicit the mean
of a distribution, or more generally the expectation of a vector-valued random variable [16, 3]. The
case of real-valued properties is also now well in hand [9, 1]. The general vector-valued case is still
generally open, with recent progress in [3, 2, 15]. Recently, a parallel thread of research has been
underway in finance, to understand which financial risk measures, among several in use or proposed
to help regulate the risks of financial institutions, are computable via regression, i.e., elicitable (cf.
references above). More often than not, these papers have concluded that most risk measures under
consideration are not elicitable, notable exceptions being generalized quantiles (e.g. value-at-risk,
expectiles) and expected utility [13, 12].
Throughout the growing momentum of the study of elicitation, one question has been central: which
properties are elicitable? It is clear, however, that all properties are “indirectly” elicitable if one first
elicits the distribution using a standard proper scoring rule. Therefore, in the present work, we
suggest replacing this question with a more nuanced one: how elicitable are various properties?
Specifically, heeding the suggestion of Gneiting [7], we adapt to our setting the notion of elicitation
complexity introduced by Lambert et al. [17], which captures how many parameters one needs to
maintain in an ERM procedure for the property in question. Indeed, if a real-valued property is
found not to be elicitable, such as the variance, one should not abandon it, but rather ask how many
parameters are required to compute it via ERM.

Our work is heavily inspired by the recent progress along these lines of Fissler and Ziegel [15], who
show that spectral risk measures of support k have elicitation complexity at most k + 1. Spectral
risk measures are among those under consideration in the finance community, and this result shows
that while not elicitable in the classical sense, their elicitation complexity is still low, and hence one
can develop reasonable regression procedures for them. Our results extend to these and many other
risk measures (see § 4.6), often providing matching lower bounds on the complexity as well.
Our contributions are the following. We first introduce an adapted definition of elicitation complexity which we believe to be the right notion to focus on going forward. We establish a few simple but
useful results which allow for a kind of calculus of elicitation; for example, conditions under which
the complexity of eliciting two properties in tandem is the sum of their individual complexities. In
§ 3, we derive several techniques for proving both upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity
which apply primarily to the Bayes risks from decision theory, or optimal expected loss functions.
The class includes spectral risk measures among several others; see § 4. We conclude with brief
remarks and open questions.

Preliminaries and Foundation

Let Ω be a set of outcomes and P ⊆ ∆(Ω) be a convex set of probability measures. The goal of
elicitation is to learn something about the distribution p ∈ P, specifically some function Γ(p) such
as the mean or variance, by minimizing a loss function.
Definition 1. A property is a function Γ : P → Rk , for some k ∈ N, which associates a desired
.
report value to each distribution.1 We let Γr = {p ∈ P | r = Γ(p)} denote the set of distributions p
corresponding to report value r.
Given a property Γ, we want to ensure that the best result is to reveal the value of the property using
a loss function that evaluates the report using a sample from the distribution.
Definition 2. A loss function L : Rk × Ω → R elicits a property Γ : P → Rk if for all p ∈ P,
.
Γ(p) = arginf r L(r, p), where L(r, p) = Ep [L(r, ·)]. A property is elicitable if some loss elicits it.
For example, when Ω = R, the mean Γ(p) = Ep [ω] is elicitable via squared loss L(r, ω) = (r−ω)2 .
A well-known necessary condition for elicitability is convexity of the level sets of Γ.
Proposition 1 (Osband [5]). If Γ is elicitable, the level sets Γr are convex for all r ∈ Γ(P).
One can easily check that the mean Γ(p) = Ep [ω] has convex level sets, yet the variance Γ(p) =
Ep [(ω − Ep [ω])2 ] does not, and hence is not elicitable [9].
It is often useful to work with a stronger condition, that not only is Γr convex, but it is the intersection
of a linear subspace with P. This condition is equivalent the existence of an identification function,
a functional describing the level sets of Γ [17, 1].
Definition 3. A function V : R×Ω → Rk is an identification function for Γ : P → Rk , or identifies
Γ, if for all r ∈ Γ(P) it holds that p ∈ Γr ⇐⇒ V (r, p) = 0 ∈ Rk , where as with L(r, p) above we
.
write V (r, p) = Ep [V (r, ω)]. Γ is identifiable if there exists a V identifying it.
One can check for example that V (r, ω) = ω − r identifies the mean.
We can now define the classes of identifiable and elicitable properties, along with the complexity
of identifying or eliciting a given property. Naturally, a property is k-identifiable if it is the link of
a k-dimensional identifiable property, and k-elicitable if it is the link of a k-dimensional elicitable
property. The elicitation complexity of a property is then simply the minimum dimension k needed
for it to be k-elicitable.
Definition 4. Let Ik (P) denote the class of all identifiable properties Γ : P →SRk , and Ek (P)
k
denote the
S class of all elicitable properties Γ : P → R . We write I(P) = k∈N Ik (P) and
E(P) = k∈N Ek (P).
Definition 5. A property Γ is k-identifiable if there exists Γ̂ ∈ Ik (P) and f such that Γ = f ◦ Γ̂.
The identification complexity of Γ is defined as iden(Γ) = min{k : Γ is k-identifiable}.
1

We will also consider Γ : P → RN .

Definition 6. A property Γ is k-elicitable if there exists Γ̂ ∈ Ek (P) and f such that Γ = f ◦ Γ̂. The
elicitation complexity of Γ is defined as elic(Γ) = min{k : Γ is k-elicitable}.
To make the above definitions concrete, recall that the variance σ 2 (p) = Ep [(Ep [ω]−ω)2 ] is not elicitable, as its level sets are not convex, a necessary condition by Prop. 1. Note however that we may
write σ 2 (p) = Ep [ω 2 ]−Ep [ω]2 , which can be obtained from the property Γ̂(p) = (Ep [ω], Ep [ω 2 ]). It
is well-known [4, 7] that Γ̂ is both elicitable and identifiable as the expectation of a vector-valued random variable X(ω) = (ω, ω 2 ), using for example L(r, ω) = kr −X(ω)k2 and V (r, ω) = r −X(ω).
Thus, we can recover σ 2 as a link of the elicitable and identifiable Γ̂ : P → R2 , and as no such
Γ̂ : P → R exists, we have iden(σ 2 ) = elic(σ 2 ) = 2.
In this example, the variance has a stronger property than merely being 2-identifiable and 2elicitable, namely that there is a single Γ̂ that satisfies both of these simultaneously. In fact this
is quite common, and identifiability provides geometric structure that we make use of in our lower
bounds. Thus, most of our results use this refined notion of elicitation complexity.
Definition 7. A property Γ has (identifiable) elicitation complexity
elicI (Γ) = min{k : ∃Γ̂, f such that Γ̂ ∈ Ek (P) ∩ Ik (P) and Γ = f ◦ Γ̂}.
Note that restricting our attention to elicI effectively requires elicI (Γ) ≥ iden(Γ); specifically, if Γ
is derived from some elicitable Γ̂, then Γ̂ must be identifiable as well. This restriction is only relevant
for our lower bounds, as our upper bounds give losses explicitly.2 Note however that some restriction
on Ek (P) is necessary, as otherwise pathological constructions giving injective mappings from R to
Rk would render all properties 1-elicitable. To alleviate this issue, some authors require continuity
(e.g. [1]) while others like we do require identifiability (e.g. [15]), which can be motivated by the
fact that for any differentiable loss L for Γ, V (r, ω) = ∇r L(·, ω) will identify Γ provided Ep [L]
has no inflection points or local minima. An important future direction is to relax this identifiability
assumption, as there are very natural (set-valued) properties with iden > elic.3
Our definition of elicitation complexity differs from the notion proposed by Lambert et al. [17], in
that the components of Γ̂ above do not need to be individually elicitable. This turns out to have
a large impact, as under their definition the property Γ(p) = maxω∈Ω p({ω}) for finite Ω has
elicitation complexity |Ω| − 1, whereas under our definition elicI (Γ) = 2; see Example 4.3. Fissler
and Ziegel [15] propose a closer but still different definition, with the complexity being the smallest
k such that Γ is a component of a k-dimensional elicitable property. Again, this definition can lead
to larger complexities than necessary; take for example the squared mean Γ(p) = Ep [ω]2 when
Ω = R, which has elicI (Γ) = 1 with Γ̂(p) = Ep [ω] and f (x) = x2 , but is not elicitable and thus has
complexity 2 under [15]. We believe that, modulo regularity assumptions on Ek (P), our definition is
better suited to studying the difficulty of eliciting properties: viewing f as a (potentially dimensionreducing) link function, our definition captures the minimum number of parameters needed in an
ERM computation of the property in question, followed by a simple one-time application of f .
2.1

Foundations of Elicitation Complexity

In the remainder of this section, we make some simple, but useful, observations about iden(Γ) and
elicI (Γ). We have already discussed one such observation after Definition 7: elicI (Γ) ≥ iden(Γ).
It is natural to start with some trivial upper bounds. Clearly, whenever p ∈ P can be uniquely determined by some number of elicitable parameters then the elicitation complexity of every property is
at most that number. The following propositions give two notable applications of this observation.4
Proposition 2. When |Ω| = n, every property Γ has elicI (Γ) ≤ n − 1.
Proof. The probability distribution is determined by the probability of any n − 1 outcomes, and the
probability associated with a given outcome is both elicitable and identifiable.
2

Our main lower bound (Thm 2) merely requires Γ to have convex level sets, which is necessary by Prop. 1.
One may take for example Γ(p) = argmaxi p(Ai ) for a finite measurable partition A1 , . . . , An of Ω.
4
Note that these restrictions on Ω may easily be placed on P instead; e.g. finite Ω is equivalent to P having
support on a finite subset of Ω, or even being piecewise constant on some disjoint events.

Proposition 3. When Ω = R,5 every property Γ has elicI (Γ) ≤ ω (countable).6
One well-studied class of properties are those where Γ is linear, i.e., the expectation of some vectorvalued random variable. All such properties are elicitable and identifiable (cf. [4, 8, 3]), with
elicI (Γ) ≤ k, but of course the complexity can be lower if the range of Γ is not full-dimensional.
Lemma 1. Let X : Ω → Rk be P-integrable and Γ(p) = Ep [X]. Then elicI (Γ) =
dim(affhull(Γ(P))), the dimension of the affine hull of the range of Γ.
It is easy to create redundant properties in various ways. For example, given elicitable properties
.
Γ1 and Γ2 the property Γ = {Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ1 + Γ2 } clearly contains redundant information. A concrete
case is Γ = {mean squared, variance, 2nd moment}, which, as we have seen, has elicI (Γ) = 2. The
following definitions and lemma capture various aspects of a lack of such redundancy.
Definition 8. Property Γ : P → Rk in I(P) is of full rank if iden(Γ) = k.
Note that there are two ways for a property to fail to be full rank. First, as the examples above
suggest, Γ can be “redundant” so that it is a link of a lower-dimensional identifiable property. Full
rank can also be violated if more dimensions are needed to identify the property than to specify it.
This is the case with, e.g., the variance which is a 1 dimensional property but has iden(σ 2 ) = 2.
Definition 9. Properties Γ, Γ0 ∈ I(P) are independent if iden({Γ, Γ0 }) = iden(Γ) + iden(Γ0 ).
Lemma 2. If Γ, Γ0 ∈ E(P) are full rank and independent, then elicI ({Γ, Γ0 }) = elicI (Γ)+elicI (Γ0 ).
To illustrate the lemma, elicI (variance) = 2, yet Γ = {mean,variance} has elicI (Γ) = 2, so clearly
the mean and variance are not both independent and full rank. (As we have seen, variance is not full
rank.) However, the mean and second moment satisfy both by Lemma 1.
Another important case is when Γ consists of some number of distinct quantiles. Osband [5] essentially showed that quantiles are independent and of full rank, so their elicitation complexity is the
number of quantiles being elicited.
Lemma 3. Let Ω = R and P be a class of probability measures with continuously differentiable and invertible CDFs F , which is sufficiently rich in the sense that for all x1 , . . . , xk ∈ R,
span({F −1 (x1 ), . . . , F −1 (xk )}, F ∈ P) = Rk . Let qα , denote the α-quantile function. Then if
α1 , . . . , αk are all distinct, Γ = {qα1 , . . . , qαk } has elicI (Γ) = k.
The quantile example in particular allows us to see that all complexity classes, including ω, are
occupied. In fact, our results to follow will show something stronger: even for real-valued properties
Γ : P → R, all classes are occupied; we give here the result that follows from our bounds on spectral
risk measures in Example 4.4, but this holds for many other P; see e.g. Example 4.2.
Proposition 4. Let P as in Lemma 3. Then for all k ∈ N there exists γ : P → R with elicI (γ) = k.

Eliciting the Bayes Risk

In this section we prove two theorems that provide our main tools for proving upper and lower
bounds respectively on elicitation complexity. Of course many properties are known to be elicitable, and the losses that elicit them provide such an upper bound for that case. We provide such
a construction for properties that can be expressed as the pointwise minimum of an indexed set of
functions. Interestingly, our construction does not elicit the minimum directly, but as a joint elicitation of the value and the function that realizes this value. The form (1) is that of a scoring rule for
the linear property p 7→ Ep [Xa ], except that here the index a itself is also elicited.7
Theorem 1. Let {Xa : Ω → R}a∈A be a set of P-integrable functions indexed by A ⊆ Rk . Then if
inf a Ep [Xa ] is attained, the property γ(p) = mina Ep [Xa ] is (k + 1)-elicitable. In particular,
L((r, a), ω) = H(r) + h(r)(Xa − r)
elicits p 7→ {(γ(p), a) : Ep [Xa ] = γ(p)} for any strictly decreasing h : R → R+ with

(1)

= h.

Here and throughout, when Ω = Rk we assume the Borel σ-algebra.
Omitted proofs can be found in the appendix of the full version of this paper.
7
As we focus on elicitation complexity, we have not tried to characterize all ways to elicit this joint property,
or other properties we give explicit losses for. See § 4.1 for an example where additional losses are possible.

Proof. We will work with gains instead of losses, and show that S((r, a), ω) = g(r) + dgr (Xa − r)
elicits p 7→ {(γ(p), a) : Ep [Xa ] = γ(p)} for γ(p) = maxa Ep [Xa ]. Here g is convex with strictly
increasing and positive subgradient dg.
For any fixed a, we have by the subgradient inequality,
S((r, a), p) = g(r) + dgr (Ep [Xa ] − r) ≤ g(Ep [Xa ]) = S((Ep [Xa ], a), p) ,
and as dg is strictly increasing, g is strictly convex, so r = Ep [Xa ] is the unique maximizer. Now
letting S̃(a, p) = S((Ep [Xa ], a), p), we have
argmax S̃(a, p) = argmax g(Ep [Xa ]) = argmax Ep [Xa ] ,

because g is strictly increasing. We now have

One natural way to get such an indexed set of functions is to take an arbitrary loss function L(r, ω),
in which case this pointwise minimum corresponds to the Bayes risk, which is simply the minimum
possible expected loss under some distribution p.
Definition 10. Given loss function L : A × Ω → R on some prediction set A, the Bayes risk of L
is defined as L(p) := inf a∈A L(a, p).
One illustration of the power of Theorem 1 is that the Bayes risk of a loss eliciting a k-dimensional
property is itself (k + 1)-elicitable.
Corollary 1. If L : Rk × Ω → R is a loss function eliciting Γ : P → Rk , then the loss
L((r, a), ω) = L0 (a, ω) + H(r) + h(r)(L(a, ω) − r)
elicits {L, Γ}, where h : R → R+ is any positive strictly decreasing function, H(r) =
and L0 is any surrogate loss eliciting Γ.8 If Γ ∈ Ik (P), elicI (L) ≤ k + 1.

We now turn to our second theorem which provides lower bounds for the elicitation complexity
of the Bayes risk. A first observation, which follows from standard convex analysis, is that L is
concave, and thus it is unlikely to be elicitable directly, as the level sets of L are likely to be nonconvex. To show a lower bound greater than 1, however, we will need much stronger techniques.
In particular, while L must be concave, it may not be strictly so, thus enabling level sets which are
potentially amenable to elicitation. In fact, L must be flat between any two distributions which share
a minimizer. Crucial to our lower bound is the fact that whenever the minimizer of L differs between
two distributions, L is essentially strictly concave between them.
Lemma 4. Suppose loss L with Bayes risk L elicits Γ : P → Rk . Then for any p, p0 ∈ P with
Γ(p) 6= Γ(p0 ), we have L(λp + (1 − λ)p0 ) > λL(p) + (1 − λ)L(p0 ) for all λ ∈ (0, 1).
With this lemma in hand we can prove our lower bound. The crucial insight is that an identification
function for the Bayes risk of a loss eliciting a property can, through a link, be used to identify that
property. Corollary 1 tells us that k + 1 parameters suffice for the Bayes risk of a k-dimensional
property, and our lower bound shows this is often necessary. Only k parameters suffice, however,
when the property value itself provides all the information required to compute the Bayes risk; for
example, dropping the y 2 term from squared loss gives L(x, y) = x2 − 2xy and L(p) = −Ep [y]2 ,
giving elic(L) = 1. Thus the theorem splits the lower bound into two cases.
Theorem 2. If a loss L elicits some Γ ∈ Ek (P) with elicitation complexity elicI (Γ) = k, then its
Bayes risk L has elicI (L) ≥ k. Moreover, if we can write L = f ◦ Γ for some function f : Rk → R,
then we have elicI (L) = k; otherwise, elicI (L) = k + 1.
Proof. Let Γ̂ ∈ E` such that L = g ◦ Γ̂ for some g : R` → R.
8
Note that one could easily lift the requirement that Γ be a function, and allow Γ(p) to be the set of minimizers of the loss (cf. [18]). We will use this additional power in Example 4.4.

5

We show by contradiction that for all p, p0 ∈ P, Γ̂(p) = Γ̂(p0 ) implies Γ(p) = Γ(p0 ). Otherwise, we
have p, p0 with Γ̂(p) = Γ̂(p0 ), and thus L(p) = L(p0 ), but Γ(p) 6= Γ(p0 ). Lemma 4 would then give
us some pλ = λp + (1 − λ)p0 with L(pλ ) > L(p). But as the level sets Γ̂r̂ are convex by Prop. 1,
we would have Γ̂(pλ ) = Γ̂(p), which would imply L(pλ ) = L(p).
We now can conclude that there exists h : R` → Rk such that Γ = h ◦ Γ̂. But as Γ̂ ∈ E` , this implies
elicI (Γ) ≤ `, so clearly we need ` ≥ k. Finally, if ` = k we have L = g ◦ Γ̂ = g ◦ h−1 ◦ Γ. The
upper bounds follow from Corollary 1.

Examples and Applications

We now give several applications of our results. Several upper bounds are novel, as well as all lower
bounds greater than 2. In the examples, unless we refer to Ω explicitly we will assume Ω = R and
write y ∈ Ω so that y ∼ p. In each setting, we also make several standard regularity assumptions
which we suppress for ease of exposition — for example, for the variance and variantile we assume
finite first and second moments (which must span R2 ), and whenever we discuss quantiles we will
assume that P is as in Lemma 3, though we will not require as much regularity for our upper bounds.
4.1

Variance

In Section 2 we showed that elicI (σ 2 ) = 2. As a warm up, let us see how to recover this statement
using our results on the Bayes risk. We can view σ 2 as the Bayes risk of squared loss L(x, y) = (x−
y)2 , which of course elicits the mean: L(p) = minx∈R Ep [(x − y)2 ] = Ep [(Ep [y] − y)2 ] = σ 2 (p).
This gives us elicI (σ 2 ) ≤ 2 by Corollary 1, with a matching lower bound by Theorem 2, as the
variance is not simply a function of the mean. Corollary 1 gives losses such as L((x, v), y) =
e−v ((x − y)2 − v) − e−v which elict {Ep [y], σ 2 (p)}, but in fact there are losses which cannot
be represented by the form (2), showing that we do not have a full characterization;
 for example,
L̂((x, v), y) = v 2 + v(x − y)(2(x + y) + 1) + (x − y)2 (x + y)2 + x + y + 1 . This L̂ was

z, which
elicits the first two moments, and link function (z1 , z2 ) 7→ (z1 , z2 − z12 ).
4.2

Convex Functions of Means

Another simple example is γ(p) = G(Ep [X]) for some strictly convex function G : Rk → R and
P-integrable X : Ω → Rk . To avoid degeneracies, we assume dim affhull{Ep [X] : p ∈ P} = k,
i.e. Γ is full rank. Letting {dGp }p∈P be a selection of subgradients of G, the loss L(r, ω) =
−(G(r) + dGr (X(ω) − r)) elicits Γ : p 7→ Ep [X] (cf. [3]), and moreover we have γ(p) = −L(p).
By Lemma 1, elicI (Γ) = k. One easily checks that L = G ◦ Γ, so now by Theorem 2, elicI (γ) = k
as well. Letting {Xk }k∈N be a family of such “full rank” random variables, this gives us a sequence
of real-valued properties γk (p) = kEp [X]k2 with elicI (γk ) = k, proving Proposition 4.
4.3

Modal Mass

With Ω = R consider the property γβ (p) = maxx∈R p([x − β, x + β]), namely, the maximum
probability mass contained in an interval of width 2β. Theorem 1 easily shows elicI (γβ ) ≤ 2,
as γ̂β (p) = argmaxx∈R p([x − β, x + β]) is elicited by L(x, y) = 1|x−y|>β , and γβ (p) = 1 −
L(p). Similarly, in the case of finite Ω, γ(p) = maxω∈Ω p({ω}) is simply the expected score (gain
rather than loss) of the mode γ(p) = argmaxω∈Ω p({ω}), which is elicitable for finite Ω (but not
otherwise; see Heinrich [19]).
In both cases, one can easily check that the level sets of γ are not convex, so elicI (γ) = 2; alternatively Theorem 2 applies in the first case. As mentioned following Definition 6, the result for finite
Ω differs from the definitions of Lambert et al. [17], where the elicitation complexity of γ is |Ω| − 1.

Expected Shortfall and Other Spectral Risk Measures

One important application of our results on the elicitation complexity of the Bayes risk is the elicitability of various financial risk measures. One of the most popular financial risk measures is
expected shortfall ESα : P → R, also called conditional value at risk (CVaR) or average value at
risk (AVaR), which we define as follows (cf. [20, eq.(18)], [21, eq.(3.21)]):
 

ESα (p) = inf Ep α1 (z − y)1z≥y − z = inf Ep α1 (z − y)(1z≥y − α) − y .

Despite the importance of elicitability to financial regulation [11, 22], ESα is not elicitable [7]. It
was recently shown by Fissler and Ziegel [15], however, that elicI (ESα ) = 2. They
R also consider the
broader class of spectral risk measures, which can be represented as ρµ (p) = [0,1] ESα (p)dµ(α),
where µ is a probability measure on [0, 1] (cf. [20, eq. (36)]). In the case where µ has finite support

µ = i=1 βi δαi for point distributions δ, βi > 0, we can rewrite ρµ using the above as:

They conclude elicI (ρµ ) ≤ k + 1 unless µ({1}) = 1 in which case elicI (ρµ ) = 1. We show how
to recover these results together with matching lower bounds. It is well-known that the infimum in
eq. (4) is attained by any of the k quantiles in qα1 (p), . . . , qαk (p), so we conclude elicI (ρµ ) ≤ k + 1
by Theorem 1, and in particular the property {ρµ , qα1 , . . . , qαk } is elicitable. The family of losses
from Corollary 1 coincide with the characterization of Fissler and Ziegel [15] (see § D.1). For a
lower bound, as elicI ({qα1 , . . . , qαk }) = k whenever the αi are distinct by Lemma 3, Theorem 2
gives us elicI (ρµ ) = k + 1 whenever µ({1}) < 1, and of course elicI (ρµ ) = 1 if µ({1}) = 1.
4.5

Variantile

The τ -expectile, a type of generalized quantile introduced by Newey and Powell [23], is defined as
the solution x = µτ to the equation Ep [|1x≥y − τ |(x − y)] = 0. (This also shows µτ ∈ I1 .) Here
we propose the τ -variantile, an asymmetric variance-like measure with respect to the τ -expectile:
just as the mean is the solution x = µ to the equation Ep [x− y] = 0, and the variance
is σ 2 (p) =

Ep [(µ − y)2 ], we define the τ -variantile στ2 by στ2 (p) = Ep |1µτ ≥y − τ |(µτ − y)2 .
It is well-known that µτ can be expressed as the minimizer of a asymmetric least squares problem:
the loss L(x, y) = |1x≥y − τ |(x − y)2 elicits µτ [23, 7]. Hence, just as the variance turned out to
be a Bayes risk for the mean, so is the τ -variantile for the τ -expectile:

is elicitable by Corollary 1, and by Theorem 2 we have elicI (στ2 ) = 2.

Deviation and Risk Measures

Rockafellar and Uryasev [21] introduce “risk quadrangles” in which they relate a risk R, deviation
D, error E, and a statistic S, all functions from random variables to the reals, as follows:
R(X) = min{C + E(X − C)},
C

D(X) = min{E(X − C)},
C

S(X) = argmin{E(X − C)} .
C

Our results provide tight bounds for many of the risk and deviation measures in their paper. The most
immediate case is the expectation quadrangle case, where E(X) = E[e(X)] for some e : R → R.
In this case, if S(X) ∈ I1 (P) Theorem 2 implies elicI (R) = elicI (D) = 2 provided S is nonconstant and e non-linear. This includes several of their examples, e.g. truncated mean, log-exp, and
rate-based. Beyond the expectation case, the authors show a Mixing Theorem, where they consider

Once again, if the Ei are all of expectation type and Si ∈ I1 , Theorem 1 gives elicI (D) =
elicI (R) ≤ k + 1, with a matching lower bound from Theorem 2 provided the Si are all independent. The Reverting Theorem for a pair E1 , E2 can be seen as a special case of the above where

one replaces E2 (X) by E2 (−X). Consequently, we have tight bounds for the elicitation complexity of several other examples, including superquantiles (the same as spectral risk measures), the
quantile-radius quadrangle, and optimized certainty equivalents of Ben-Tal and Teboulle [24].
Our results offer an explaination for the existence of regression procedures for some of these
risk/deviation measures. For example, a proceedure called superquantile regression was introduced
in Rockafellar et al. [25], which computes spectral risk measures. In light of Theorem 1, one could
interpret their procedure as simply performing regression on the k different quantiles as well as the
Bayes risk. In fact, our results show that any risk/deviation generated by mixing several expectation
quadrangles will have a similar procedure, in which the Bi0 variables are simply computed along side
the measure of interest. Even more broadly, such regression procedures exist for any Bayes risk.

Discussion

We have outlined a theory of elicitation complexity which we believe is the right notion of complexity for ERM, and provided techniques and results for upper and lower bounds. In particular, we now
have tight bounds for the large class of Bayes risks, including several applications of note such as
spectral risk measures. Our results also offer an explanation for why procedures like superquantile
regression are possible, and extend this logic to all Bayes risks.
There many natural open problems in elicitation complexity. Perhaps the most apparent are the
characterizations of the complexity classes {Γ : elic(Γ) = k}, and in particular, determining the
elicitation complexity of properties which are known to be non-elicitabile, such as the mode [19]
and smallest confidence interval [18].
In this paper we have focused on elicitation complexity with respect to the class of identifiable
properties I, which we denoted elicI . This choice of notation was deliberate; one may define
elicC := min{k : ∃Γ̂ ∈ Ek ∩ C, ∃f, Γ = f ◦ Γ̂} to be the complexity with respect to some arbitrary
class of properties C. Some examples of interest might be elicE for expected values, of interest to
the prediction market literature [8], and eliccvx for properties elicitable by a loss which is convex in
r, of interest for efficiently performing ERM.
Another interesting line of questioning follows from the notion of conditional elicitation, properties
which are elicitable as long as the value of some other elicitable property is known. This notion
was introduced by Emmer et al. [11], who showed that the variance and expected shortfall are both
conditionally elicitable, on Ep [y] and qα (p) respectively. Intuitively, knowing that Γ is elicitable
conditional on an elicitable Γ0 would suggest that perhaps the pair {Γ, Γ0 } is elicitable; Fissler and
Ziegel [15] note that it is an open question whether this joint elicitability holds in general. The Bayes
risk L for Γ is elicitable conditioned on Γ, and as we saw above, the pair {Γ, L} is jointly elicitable
as well. We give a counter-example in Figure 1, however, which also illustrates the subtlety of
characterizing all elicitable properties.

Figure 1: Depictions of the level sets of two properties, one elicitable and the other not. The left is a Bayes risk
together with its property, and thus elicitable, while the right is shown in [3] not to be elicitable. Here the planes
are shown to illustrate the fact that these are both conditionally elicitable: the height of the plane (the intersept
(p3 , 0, 0) for example) is elicitable from the characterizations for scalar properties [9, 1], and conditioned on
the plane, the properties are both linear and thus links of expected values, which are also elicitable.
