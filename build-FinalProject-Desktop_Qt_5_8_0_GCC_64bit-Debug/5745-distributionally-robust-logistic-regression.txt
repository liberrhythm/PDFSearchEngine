Abstract
This paper proposes a distributionally robust approach to logistic regression. We
use the Wasserstein distance to construct a ball in the space of probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples. If the radius of
this ball is chosen judiciously, we can guarantee that it contains the unknown datagenerating distribution with high confidence. We then formulate a distributionally robust logistic regression model that minimizes a worst-case expected logloss
function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein
ball. We prove that this optimization problem admits a tractable reformulation
and encapsulates the classical as well as the popular regularized logistic regression
problems as special cases. We further propose a distributionally robust approach
based on Wasserstein balls to compute upper and lower confidence bounds on the
misclassification probability of the resulting classifier. These bounds are given by
the optimal values of two highly tractable linear programs. We validate our theoretical out-of-sample guarantees through simulated and empirical experiments.

Introduction

Logistic regression is one of the most frequently used classification methods [1]. Its objective is to
establish a probabilistic relationship between a continuous feature vector and a binary explanatory
variable. However, in spite of its overwhelming success in machine learning, data analytics and
medicine etc., logistic regression models can display a poor out-of-sample performance if training
data is sparse. In this case modelers often resort to ad hoc regularization techniques in order to
combat overfitting effects. This paper aims to develop new regularization techniques for logistic
regression—and to provide intuitive probabilistic interpretations for existing ones—by using tools
from modern distributionally robust optimization.
Logistic Regression: Let x ∈ Rn denote a feature vector and y ∈ {−1, +1} the associated binary
label to be predicted. In logistic regression, the conditional distribution of y given x is modeled as
−1

Prob(y|x) = [1 + exp(−yhβ, xi)]

,

(1)

where the weight vector β ∈ Rn constitutes an unknown regression parameter. Suppose that N
training samples {(x̂i , ŷi )}N
i=1 have been observed. Then, the maximum likelihood estimator of
classical logistic regression is found by solving the geometric program
min

N
1 X
lβ (x̂i , ŷi ) ,
N i=1

(2)

whose objective function is given by the sample average of the logloss function lβ (x, y) = log(1 +
exp (−yhβ, xi)). It has been observed, however, that the resulting maximum likelihood estimator
may display a poor out-of-sample performance. Indeed, it is well documented that minimizing the
average logloss function leads to overfitting and weak classification performance [2, 3]. In order
1

to overcome this deficiency, it has been proposed to modify the objective function of problem (2)
[4, 5, 6]. An alternative approach is to add a regularization term to the logloss function in order to
mitigate overfitting. These regularization techniques lead to a modified optimization problem
N
1 X
min
lβ (x̂i , ŷi ) + εR(β) ,
(3)
β N

where R(β) and ε denote the regularization function and the associated coefficient, respectively.
A popular choice for the regularization term is R(β) = kβk, where k · k denotes a generic norm
such as the `1 or the `2 -norm. The use of `1 -regularization tends to induce sparsity in β, which in
turn helps to combat overfitting effects [7]. Moreover, `1 -regularized logistic regression serves as
an effective means for feature selection. It is further shown in [8] that `1 -regularization outperforms
`2 -regularization when the number of training samples is smaller than the number of features. On
the downside, `1 -regularization leads to non-smooth optimization problems, which are more challenging. Algorithms for large scale regularized logistic regression are discussed in [9, 10, 11, 12].
Distributionally Robust Optimization: Regression and classification problems are typically
modeled as optimization problems under uncertainty. To date, optimization under uncertainty has
been addressed by several complementary modeling paradigms that differ mainly in the representation of uncertainty. For instance, stochastic programming assumes that the uncertainty is governed
by a known probability distribution and aims to minimize a probability functional such as the expected cost or a quantile of the cost distribution [13, 14]. In contrast, robust optimization ignores
all distributional information and aims to minimize the worst-case cost under all possible uncertainty realizations [15, 16, 17]. While stochastic programs may rely on distributional information
that is not available or hard to acquire in practice, robust optimization models may adopt an overly
pessimistic view of the uncertainty and thereby promote over-conservative decisions.
The emerging field of distributionally robust optimization aims to bridge the gap between the conservatism of robust optimization and the specificity of stochastic programming: it seeks to minimize
a worst-case probability functional (e.g., the worst-case expectation), where the worst case is taken
with respect to an ambiguity set, that is, a family of distributions consistent with the given prior
information on the uncertainty. The vast majority of the existing literature focuses on ambiguity sets
characterized through moment and support information, see e.g. [18, 19, 20]. However, ambiguity
sets can also be constructed via distance measures in the space of probability distributions such as
the Prohorov metric [21] or the Kullback-Leibler divergence [22]. Due to its attractive measure
concentration properties, we use here the Wasserstein metric to construct ambiguity sets.
Contribution: In this paper we propose a distributionally robust perspective on logistic regression. Our research is motivated by the well-known observation that regularization techniques can
improve the out-of-sample performance of many classifiers. In the context of support vector machines and Lasso, there have been several recent attempts to give ad hoc regularization techniques a
robustness interpretation [23, 24]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such connection has
been established for logistic regression. In this paper we aim to close this gap by adopting a new distributionally robust optimization paradigm based on Wasserstein ambiguity sets [25]. Starting from
a data-driven distributionally robust statistical learning setup, we will derive a family of regularized
logistic regression models that admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation and encapsulate the
classical regularized logistic regression (3) as a special case. Moreover, by invoking recent measure
concentration results, our proposed approach provides a probabilistic guarantee for the emerging
regularized classifiers, which seems to be the first result of this type. All proofs are relegated to the
technical appendix. We summarize our main contributions as follows:
• Distributionally robust logistic regression model and tractable reformulation: We propose a
data-driven distributionally robust logistic regression model based on an ambiguity set induced by
the Wasserstein distance. We prove that the resulting semi-infinite optimization problem admits
an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program.
• Risk estimation: Using similar distributionally robust optimization techniques based on the
Wasserstein ambiguity set, we develop two highly tractable linear programs whose optimal values
provide confidence bounds on the misclassification probability or risk of the emerging classifiers.
• Out-of-sample performance guarantees: Adopting a distributionally robust framework allows
us to invoke results from the measure concentration literature to derive finite-sample probabilistic
2

guarantees. Specifically, we establish out-of-sample performance guarantees for the classifiers
obtained from the proposed distributionally robust optimization model.
• Probabilistic interpretation of existing regularization techniques: We show that the standard
regularized logistic regression is a special case of our framework. In particular, we show that the
regularization coefficient ε in (3) can be interpreted as the size of the ambiguity set underlying
our distributionally robust optimization model.

A distributionally robust perspective on statistical learning

In the standard statistical learning setting all training and test samples are drawn independently from
some distribution P supported on Ξ = Rn × {−1, +1}. If the distribution P was known, the best
weight parameter β could be found by solving the stochastic optimization problem
Z
	
 P
inf E [lβ (x, y)] =
lβ (x, y)P(d(x, y)) .
(4)
β

Rn ×{−1,+1}

In practice, however, P is only indirectly observable through N independent training samples. Thus,
the distribution P is itself uncertain, which motivates us to address problem (4) from a distributionally robust perspective. This means that we use the training samples to construct an ambiguity set
P, that is, a family of distributions that contains the unknown distribution P with high confidence.
Then we solve the distributionally robust optimization problem
inf sup EQ [lβ (x, y)] ,
β Q∈P

(5)

which minimizes the worst-case expected logloss function. The construction of the ambiguity set
P should be guided by the following principles. (i) Tractability: It must be possible to solve the
distributionally robust optimization problem (5) efficiently. (ii) Reliability: The optimizer of (5)
should be near-optimal in (4), thus facilitating attractive out-of-sample guarantees. (iii) Asymptotic
consistency: For large training data sets, the solution of (5) should converge to the one of (4). In this
paper we propose to use the Wasserstein metric to construct P as a ball in the space of probability
distributions that satisfies (i)–(iii).
Definition 1 (Wasserstein Distance). Let M (Ξ2 ) denote the set of probability distributions on Ξ×Ξ.
The Wasserstein distance between two distributions P and Q supported on Ξ is defined as
Z

W (Q, P) := inf 2
d(ξ, ξ 0 ) Π(dξ, dξ 0 ) : Π(dξ, Ξ) = Q(dξ), Π(Ξ, dξ 0 ) = P(dξ 0 ) ,
Π∈M (Ξ )

Ξ2

where ξ = (x, y) and d(ξ, ξ 0 ) is a metric on Ξ.
The Wasserstein distance represents the minimum cost of moving the distribution P to the distribution Q, where the cost of moving a unit mass from ξ to ξ 0 amounts to d(ξ, ξ 0 ).
In the remainder, we denote by Bε (P) := {Q : W (Q, P) ≤ ε} the ball of radius ε centered at P with
respect to the Wasserstein distance. In this paper we propose to use Wasserstein balls as ambiguity
sets. Given the training data points {(x̂i , ŷi )}N
, a natural candidate for the center of the Wasseri=1
PN
stein ball is the empirical distribution P̂N = N1 i=1 δ(x̂i ,ŷi ) , where δ(x̂i ,ŷi ) denotes the Dirac point
measure at (x̂i , ŷi ). Thus, we henceforth examine the distributionally robust optimization problem

equipped with a Wasserstein ambiguity set. Note that (6) reduces to the average logloss minimization

Tractable reformulation and probabilistic guarantees

In this section we demonstrate that (6) can be reformulated as a tractable convex program and establish probabilistic guarantees for its optimal solutions.

3.1

Tractable reformulation

We first define a metric on the feature-label space, which will be used in the remainder.
Definition 2 (Metric on the Feature-Label Space).
The distance between two data points

(x, y), (x0 , y 0 ) ∈ Ξ is defined as d (x, y), (x0 , y 0 ) = kx − x0 k + κ|y − y 0 |/2 , where k · k is
any norm on Rn , and κ is a positive weight.
The parameter κ in Definition 2 represents the relative emphasis between feature mismatch and label
uncertainty. The following theorem presents a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust
optimization problem (6) and thus constitutes the first main result of this paper.
Theorem 1 (Tractable Reformulation). The optimization problem (6) is equivalent to

Note that (7) constitutes a tractable convex program for most commonly used norms k · k.
Remark 1 (Regularized Logistic Regression). As the parameter κ > 0 characterizing the metric
d(·, ·) tends to infinity, the second constraint group in the convex program (7) becomes redundant.
Hence, (7) reduces to the celebrated regularized logistic regression problem
inf εkβk∗ +

where the regularization function is determined by the dual norm on the feature space, while the
regularization coefficient coincides with the radius of the Wasserstein ball. Note that for κ = ∞
the Wasserstein distance between two distributions is infinite if they assign different labels to a
fixed feature vector with positive probability. Any distribution in Bε (P̂N ) must then have nonoverlapping conditional supports for y = +1 and y = −1. Thus, setting κ = ∞ reflects the belief
that the label is a (deterministic) function of the feature and that label measurements are exact. As
this belief is not tenable in most applications, an approach with κ < ∞ may be more satisfying.
3.2

Out-of-sample performance guarantees

We now exploit a recent measure concentration result characterizing the speed at which P̂N converges to P with respect to the Wasserstein distance [26] in order to derive out-of-sample performance guarantees for distributionally robust logistic regression.
In the following, we let Ξ̂N := {(x̂i , ŷi )}N
i=1 be a set of N independent training samples from P,
and we denote by β̂, λ̂, and ŝi the optimal solutions and Jˆ the corresponding optimal value of (7).
Note that these values are random objects as they depend on the random training data Ξ̂N .
Theorem 2 (Out-of-Sample Performance). Assume that the distribution P is light-tailed, i.e. , there
is a > 1 with A := EP [exp(k2xka )] < +∞. If the radius ε of the Wasserstein ball is set to

then we have PN P ∈ Bε (P̂N ) ≥ 1 − η, implying that PN {Ξ̂N : EP [l (x, y)] ≤ J}
β̂

for all sample sizes N ≥ 1 and confidence levels η ∈ (0, 1]. Moreover, the positive constants c1 , c2 ,
and c3 appearing in (8) depend only on the light-tail parameters a and A, the dimension n of the
feature space, and the metric on the feature-label space.
Remark 2 (Worst-Case Loss). Denoting the empirical logloss function on the training set Ξ̂N by

EP̂ [lβ̂ (x, y)], the worst-case loss Jˆ can be expressed as

Jˆ = λ̂ε + EP̂ [lβ̂ (x, y)] +

(9)

Note that the last term in (9) can be viewed as a complementary regularization term that does not
appear in standard regularized logistic regression. This term accounts for label uncertainty and
decreases with κ. Thus, κ can be interpreted as our trust in the labels of the training samples. Note
that this regularization term vanishes for κ → ∞. One can further prove that λ̂ converges to kβ̂k∗
for κ → ∞, implying that (9) reduces to the standard regularized logistic regression in this limit.
Remark 3 (Performance Guarantees). The following comments are in order:
I. Light-Tail Assumption: The light-tail assumption of Theorem 2 is restrictive but seems to
be unavoidable for any a priori guarantees of the type described in Theorem 2. Note that this
assumption is automatically satisfied if the features have bounded support or if they are known
to follow, for instance, a Gaussian or exponential distribution.
II. Asymptotic Consistency: For any fixed confidence level η, the radius εN (η) defined in (8)
drops to zero as the sample size N increases, and thus the ambiguity set shrinks to a singleton.
To be more precise, with probability 1 across all training datasets, a sequence of distributions
in the ambiguity set (8) converges in the Wasserstein metric, and thus weakly, to the unknown
data generating distribution P; see [25, Corollary 3.4] for a formal proof. Consequently, the
solution of (2) can be shown to converge to the solution of (4) as N increases.
III. Finite Sample Behavior: The a priori bound (8) on the size of the Wasserstein ball has two
1
1
growth regimes. For small N , the radius decreases as N a , and for large N it scales with N n ,
where n is the dimension of the feature space. We refer to [26, Section 1.3] for further details
on the optimality of these rates and potential improvements for special cases. Note that when
the support of the underlying distribution P is bounded or P has a Gaussian distribution, the
parameter a can be effectively set to 1.
3.3

Risk Estimation: Worst- and Best-Cases

One of the main objectives in logistic regression is to control the classification performance. Specifically, we are interested in predicting labels from features.
This can be achieved via a classifier

function fβ : Rn → {+1, −1}, whose risk R(β) := P y 6= fβ (x) represents the misclassification
probability. In logistic regression, a natural choice for the classifier is fβ (x) = +1 if Prob(+1|x) >
0.5; = −1 otherwise. The conditional probability Prob(y|x)
is defined
in (1). The risk associated


with this classifier can be expressed as R(β) = EP 1{yhβ,xi≤0} . As in Section 3.1, we can use
worst- and best-case expectations over Wasserstein balls to construct confidence bounds on the risk.
Theorem 3 (Risk Estimation). For any β̂ depending on the training dataset {(x̂i , ŷi )}N
i=1 we have:
(i) The worst-case risk Rmax (β̂) := supQ∈Bε (P̂N ) EQ [1{yhβ̂,xi≤0} ] is given by

Numerical Results

We now showcase the power of distributionally robust logistic regression in simulated and empirical
experiments. All optimization problems are implemented in MATLAB via the modeling language
YALMIP [27] and solved with the state-of-the-art nonlinear programming solver IPOPT [28]. All
experiments were run on an Intel XEON CPU (3.40GHz). For the largest instance studied (N =
1000), the problems (2), (3), (7) and (10) were solved in 2.1, 4.2, 9.2 and 0.05 seconds, respectively.
4.1

Experiment 1: Out-of-Sample Performance

We use a simulation experiment to study the out-of-sample performance guarantees offered by distributionally robust logistic regression. As in [8], we assume that the features x ∈ R10 follow a multivariate standard normal distribution and that the conditional distribution of the labels y ∈ {+1, −1}
is of the form (1) with β = (10, 0, . . . , 0). The true distribution P is uniquely determined by this
information. If we use the `∞ -norm to measure distances in the feature space, then P satisfies the
light-tail assumption of Theorem 2 for 2 > a & 1. Finally, we set κ = 1.
Our experiment comprises 100 simulation runs. In each run we generate N ∈ {10, 102 , 103 } training samples and 104 test samples from P. We calibrate the distributionally robust logistic regression
model (6) to the training data and use the test data to evaluate the average logloss as well as the
correct classification rate (CCR) of the classifier associated with β̂. We then record the percentage
ˆ Moreover, we calculate the avη̂N (ε) of simulation runs in which the average logloss exceeds J.
erage CCR across all simulation runs. Figure 1 displays both 1 − η̂N (ε) and the average CCR as a
function of ε for different values of N . Note that 1 − η̂N (ε) quantifies the probability (with respect
to the training data) that P belongs to the Wasserstein ball of radius ε around the empirical distribution P̂N . Thus, 1 − η̂N (ε) increases with ε. The average CCR benefits from the regularization
induced by the distributional robustness and increases with ε as long as the empirical confidence
1 − η̂N (ε) is smaller than 1. As soon as the Wasserstein ball is large enough to contain the distribution P with high confidence (1 − η̂N (ε) . 1), however, any further increase of ε is detrimental to
the average CCR.
Figure 1 also indicates that the radius ε implied by a fixed empirical confidence level scales inversely
with the number of training samples N . Specifically, for N = 10, 102 , 103 , the Wasserstein radius
implied by the confidence level 1 − η̂ = 95% is given by ε ≈ 0.2, 0.02, 0.003, respectively. This
observation is consistent with the a priori estimate (8) of the Wasserstein radius εN (η) associated
1
with a given η. Indeed, as a & 1, Theorem 2 implies that εN (η) scales with N a . N for ε ≥ c3 .

4.2

Experiment 2: The Effect of the Wasserstein Ball

In the second simulation experiment we study the statistical properties of the out-of-sample logloss.
As in [2], we set n = 10 and assume that the features follow a multivariate standard normal distribution, while the conditional distribution of the labels is of the form (1) with β sampled uniformly from
the unit sphere. We use the `2 -norm in the feature space, and we set κ = 1. All results reported here
are averaged over 100 simulation runs. In each trial, we use N = 102 training samples to calibrate
problem (6) and 104 test samples to estimate the logloss distribution of the resulting classifier.
Figure 2(a) visualizes the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the out-of-sample logloss distribution for various confidence levels and for different values of ε. The CVaR of the logloss at level
α is defined as the conditional expectation of the logloss above its (1 − α)-quantile, see [29]. In
other words, the CVaR at level α quantifies the average of the α × 100% worst logloss realizations.
As expected, using a distributionally robust approach renders the logistic regression problem more
‘risk-averse’, which results in uniformly lower CVaR values of the logloss, particularly for smaller
confidence levels. Thus, increasing the radius of the Wasserstein ball reduces the right tail of the
logloss distribution. Figure 2(c) confirms this observation by showing that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the logloss converges to a step function for large ε. Moreover, one can prove
that the weight vector β̂ tends to zero as ε grows. Specifically, for ε ≥ 0.1 we have β ≈ 0, in
which case the logloss approximates the deterministic value log(2) = 0.69. Zooming into the CVaR
graph of Figure 2(a) at the end of the high confidence levels, we observe that the 100%-CVaR, which
coincides in fact with the expected logloss, increases at every quantile level; see Figure 2(b).
4.3

Experiment 3: Real World Case Studies and Risk Estimation

Next, we validate the performance of the proposed distributionally robust logistic regression method
on the MNIST dataset [30] and three popular datasets from the UCI repository: Ionosphere, Thoracic
Surgery, and Breast Cancer [31]. In this experiment, we use the distance function of Definition 2
with the `1 -norm. We examine three different models: logistic regression (LR), regularized logistic
regression (RLR), and distributionally robust logistic regression with κ = 1 (DRLR). All results
reported here are averaged over 100 independent trials. In each trial related to a UCI dataset, we
randomly select 60% of data to train the models and the rest to test the performance. Similarly, in
each trial related to the MNIST dataset, we randomly select 103 samples from the training dataset,
and test the performance on the complete test dataset. The results in Table 1 (top) indicate that
DRLR outperforms RLR in terms of CCR by about the same amount by which RLR outperforms
classical LR (0.3%–1%), consistently across all experiments. We also evaluated the out-of-sample
CVaR of logloss, which is a natural performance indicator for robust methods. Table 1 (bottom)
shows that DRLR wins by a large margin (outperforming RLR by 4%–43%).
In the remainder we focus on the Ionosphere case study (the results of which are representative
for the other case studies). Figures 3(a) and 3(b) depict the logloss and the CCR for different
Wasserstein radii ε. DRLR (κ = 1) outperforms RLR (κ = ∞) consistently for all sufficiently
small values of ε. This observation can be explained by the fact that DRLR accounts for uncertainty
in the label, whereas RLR does not. Thus, there is a wider range of Wasserstein radii that result in

an attractive out-of-sample logloss and CCR. This effect facilitates the choice of ε and could be a
significant advantage in situations where it is difficult to determine ε a priori.
In the experiment underlying Figure 3(c), we first fix β̂ to the optimal solution of (7) for ε = 0.003
and κ = 1. Figure 3(c) shows the true risk R(β̂) and its confidence bounds. As expected, for ε = 0
the upper and lower bounds coincide with the empirical risk on the training data, which is a lower
bound for the true risk on the test data due to over-fitting effects. As ε increases, the confidence
interval between the bounds widens and eventually covers the true risk. For instance, at ε ≈ 0.05
the confidence interval is given by [0, 0.19] and contains the true risk with probability 1−2η̂ = 95%.
