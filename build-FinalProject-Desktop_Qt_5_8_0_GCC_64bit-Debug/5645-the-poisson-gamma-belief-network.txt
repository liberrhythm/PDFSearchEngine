Abstract
To infer a multilayer representation of high-dimensional count vectors, we propose the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN) that factorizes each of its layers
into the product of a connection weight matrix and the nonnegative real hidden
units of the next layer. The PGBN’s hidden layers are jointly trained with an
upward-downward Gibbs sampler, each iteration of which upward samples Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors starting from the first layer (bottom data
layer), and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units starting from
the top hidden layer. The gamma-negative binomial process combined with a
layer-wise training strategy allows the PGBN to infer the width of each layer given
a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The PGBN with a single hidden layer
reduces to Poisson factor analysis. Example results on text analysis illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network
structure, and demonstrate that the PGBN, whose hidden units are imposed with
correlated gamma priors, can add more layers to increase its performance gains
over Poisson factor analysis, given the same limit on the width of the first layer.

Introduction

There has been significant recent interest in deep learning. Despite its tremendous success in supervised learning, inferring a multilayer data representation in an unsupervised manner remains a
challenging problem [1, 2, 3]. The sigmoid belief network (SBN), which connects the binary units
of adjacent layers via the sigmoid functions, infers a deep representation of multivariate binary vectors [4, 5]. The deep belief network (DBN) [6] is a SBN whose top hidden layer is replaced by the
restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [7] that is undirected. The deep Boltzmann machine (DBM)
is an undirected deep network that connects the binary units of adjacent layers using the RBMs [8].
All these deep networks are designed to model binary observations. Although one may modify the
bottom layer to model Gaussian and multinomial observations, the hidden units of these networks
are still typically restricted to be binary [8, 9, 10]. One may further consider the exponential family
harmoniums [11, 12] to construct more general networks with non-binary hidden units, but often at
the expense of noticeably increased complexity in training and data fitting.
Moving beyond conventional deep networks using binary hidden units, we construct a deep directed
network with gamma distributed nonnegative real hidden units to unsupervisedly infer a multilayer
representation of multivariate count vectors, with a simple but powerful mechanism to capture the
correlations among the visible/hidden features across all layers and handle highly overdispersed
counts. The proposed model is called the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), which factorizes
the observed count vectors under the Poisson likelihood into the product of a factor loading matrix
and the gamma distributed hidden units (factor scores) of layer one; and further factorizes the shape
parameters of the gamma hidden units of each layer into the product of a connection weight matrix
and the gamma hidden units of the next layer. Distinct from previous deep networks that often utilize
binary units for tractable inference and require tuning both the width (number of hidden units) of
each layer and the network depth (number of layers), the PGBN employs nonnegative real hidden
1

units and automatically infers the widths of subsequent layers given a fixed budget on the width of
its first layer. Note that the budget could be infinite and hence the whole network can grow without
bound as more data are being observed. When the budget is finite and hence the ultimate capacity
of the network is limited, we find that the PGBN equipped with a narrower first layer could increase
its depth to match or even outperform a shallower network with a substantially wider first layer.
The gamma distribution density function has the highly desired strong non-linearity for deep learning, but the existence of neither a conjugate prior nor a closed-form maximum likelihood estimate
for its shape parameter makes a deep network with gamma hidden units appear unattractive. Despite
seemingly difficult, we discover that, by generalizing the data augmentation and marginalization
techniques for discrete data [13], one may propagate latent counts one layer at a time from the bottom data layer to the top hidden layer, with which one may derive an efficient upward-downward
Gibbs sampler that, one layer at a time in each iteration, upward samples Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units.
In addition to constructing a new deep network that well fits multivariate count data and developing
an efficient upward-downward Gibbs sampler, other contributions of the paper include: 1) combining the gamma-negative binomial process [13, 14] with a layer-wise training strategy to automatically infer the network structure; 2) revealing the relationship between the upper bound imposed on
the width of the first layer and the inferred widths of subsequent layers; 3) revealing the relationship
between the network depth and the model’s ability to model overdispersed counts; 4) and generating
a multivariate high-dimensional random count vector, whose distribution is governed by the PGBN,
by propagating the gamma hidden units of the top hidden layer back to the bottom data layer.

Useful count distributions and their relationships

Let the Chinese restaurant table (CRT)
Pn distribution l ∼ CRT(n, r) represent the distribution of
a random count generated as l =
i=1 bi , bi ∼ Bernoulli [r/(r + i − 1)] . Its probability mass
l

Γ(r)r
function (PMF) can be expressed as P (l | n, r) = Γ(n+r)
|s(n, l)|, where l ∈ Z, Z := {0, 1, . . . , n},
and |s(n, l)| are unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind. Let u ∼ Log(p) denote the logarithmic
pu
1
distribution with PMF P (u | p) = − ln(1−p)
u , where u ∈ {1, 2, . . .}. Let n ∼ NB(r, p) denote
n
r
the negative binomial (NB) distribution with PMF P (n | r, p) = Γ(n+r)
n!Γ(r) p (1 − p) , where n ∈ Z.
The NB distribution n ∼ NB(r, p) can be generated as a gamma mixed Poisson distribution as n ∼
Pois(λ), λ ∼ Gam [r, p/(1 − p)] , where p/(1 − p) is the gamma scale parameter. As shown in [13],
the joint distribution of n and l given r and p in l ∼ CRT(n, r), n ∼ NB(r, p), where l ∈ {0, . . . , n}
Pl
and n ∈ Z, is the same as that in n = t=1 ut , ut ∼ Log(p), l ∼ Pois[−r ln(1 − p)], which is

called the Poisson-logarithmic bivariate distribution, with PMF P (n, l | r, p) =

Sigmoid and deep belief networks. Under the hierarchical model in (1), given the connection

Comparing (4) with (5) clearly shows the differences between the gamma nonnegative hidden units
and the sigmoid link based binary hidden units. Note that the rectified linear units have emerged as
powerful alternatives of sigmoid units to introduce nonlinearity [15]. It would be interesting to use
the gamma units to introduce nonlinearity in the positive region of the rectified linear units.
Deep Poisson factor analysis. With T = 1, the PGBN specified by (1)-(3) reduces to Poisson factor
analysis (PFA) using the (truncated) gamma-negative binomial process [13], which is also related
(1)
(1)
to latent Dirichlet allocation [16] if the Dirichlet priors are imposed on both φk and θ j . With
T ≥ 2, the PGBN is related to the gamma Markov chain hinted by Corollary 2 of [13] and realized
in [17], the deep exponential family of [18], and the deep PFA of [19]. Different from the PGBN,
in [18], it is the gamma scale but not shape parameters that are chained and factorized; in [19], it is
the correlations between binary topic usage indicators but not the full connection weights that are
captured; and neither [18] nor [19] provide a principled way to learn the network structure. Below
we break the PGBN of T layers into T related submodels that are solved with the same subroutine.

Modeling overdispersed counts

In comparison to a single-layer shallow model with T = 1 that assumes the hidden units of layer
one to be independent in the prior, the multilayer deep model with T ≥ 2 captures the correlations
between them. Note that for the extreme case that Φ(t) = IKt for t ≥ 2 are all identity matrices,
(t−1)
which indicates that there are no correlations between the features of θ j
left to be captured, the
(1)(2)

deep structure could still provide benefits as it helps model latent counts mj
that may be highly
overdispersed. For example, supposing Φ(t) = IK2 for all t ≥ 2, then from (1) and (9) we have

built on the gamma-negative binomial process [13] (or with απk for the hierarchical Dirichlet process latent Dirichlet allocation, see [23] and [22] for details), and add an additional term to account
for the possibility of creating an additional topic [22]. For simplicity, in this paper, we truncate the

Learning the network structure with layer-wise training

As jointly training all layers together is often difficult, existing deep networks are typically trained
using a greedy layer-wise unsupervised training algorithm, such as the one proposed in [6] to train
the deep belief networks. The effectiveness of this training strategy is further analyzed in [24]. By
contrast, the PGBN has a simple Gibbs sampler to jointly train all its hidden layers, as described in
Section 2.3, and hence does not require greedy layer-wise training. Yet the same as commonly used
deep learning algorithms, it still needs to specify the number of layers and the width of each layer.
In this paper, we adopt the idea of layer-wise training for the PGBN, not because of the lack of
an effective joint-training algorithm, but for the purpose of learning the width of each hidden layer
in a greedy layer-wise manner, given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The proposed
layer-wise training strategy is summarized in Algorithm 1. With a PGBN of T − 1 layers that has
already been trained, the key idea is to use a truncated gamma-negative binomial process [13] to

jointly trained, but with the structure below the newly added layer kept unchanged. Note that when
T = 1, the PGBN would infer the number of active factors if K1 max is set large enough, otherwise,
it would still assign the factors with different weights rk , but may not be able to prune any of them.

Experimental Results

We apply the PGBNs for topic modeling of text corpora, each document of which is represented
as a term-frequency count vector. Note that the PGBN with a single hidden layer is identical to
the (truncated) gamma-negative binomial process PFA of [13], which is a nonparametric Bayesian
algorithm that performs similarly to the hierarchical Dirichlet process latent Dirichlet allocation
[23] for text analysis, and is considered as a strong baseline that outperforms a large number of
topic modeling algorithms. Thus we will focus on making comparison to the PGBN with a single
layer, with its layer width set to be large to approximate the performance of the gamma-negative
binomial process PFA. We evaluate the PGBNs’ performance by examining both how well they
unsupervisedly extract low-dimensional features for document classification, and how well they
predict heldout word tokens. Matlab code will be available in http://mingyuanzhou.github.io/.
We use Algorithm 1 to learn, in a layer-wise manner, from the training data the weight matrices
Φ(1) , . . . , Φ(Tmax ) and the top-layer hidden units’ gamma shape parameters r: to add layer T to
a previously trained network with T − 1 layers, we use BT iterations to jointly train Φ(T ) and r
together with {Φ(t) }1,T −1 , prune the inactive factors of layer T , and continue the joint training with
another CT iterations. We set the hyper-parameters as a0 = b0 = 0.01 and e0 = f0 = 1. Given
the trained network, we apply the upward-downward Gibbs sampler to collect 500 MCMC samples
(1) (1)
after 500 burnins to estimate the posterior mean of the feature usage proportion vector θ j /θ·j at
the first hidden layer, for every document in both the training and testing sets.
Feature learning for binary classification.
We consider the 20 newsgroups dataset
(http://qwone.com/∼jason/20Newsgroups/) that consists of 18,774 documents from 20 different
news groups, with a vocabulary of size K0 = 61,188. It is partitioned into a training set of 11,269
documents and a testing set of 7,505 ones. We first consider two binary classification tasks that distinguish between the comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and comp.sys.mac.hardware, and between the
sci.electronics and sci.med news groups. For each binary classification task, we remove a standard
list of stop words and only consider the terms that appear at least five times, and report the classification accuracies based on 12 independent random trials. With the upper bound of the first layer’s

Classification accuracy (%) of the PGBNs for 20newsgroups multi-class classification (a) as a
function of the depth T with various K1 max and (b) as a function of K1 max with various depths, with η (t) =
0.05 for all layers. The widths of hidden layers are automatically inferred, with K1 max = 50, 100, 200, 400,
600, or 800. Note that K1 max = 800 is large enough to cover all active first-layer topics, whereas all the
first-layer topics would be used if K1 max = 50, 100, or 200.

width set as K1 max ∈ {25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800}, and Bt = Ct = 1000 and η (t) = 0.01 for
all t, we use Algorithm 1 to train a network with T ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 8} layers. Denote θ̄ j as the estimated K1 dimensional feature vector for document j, where K1 ≤ K1 max is the inferred number of
active factors of the first layer that is bounded by the pre-specified truncation level K1 max . We use
the L2 regularized logistic regression provided by the LIBLINEAR package [25] to train a linear
classifier on θ̄ j in the training set and use it to classify θ̄ j in the test set, where the regularization
parameter is five-folder cross-validated on the training set from (2−10 , 2−9 , . . . , 215 ).
As shown in Fig. 1, modifying the PGBN from a single-layer shallow network to a multilayer deep one clearly improves the qualities of the unsupervisedly extracted feature vectors.
In a random trial, with K1 max = 800, we infer a network structure of (K1 , . . . , K8 ) =
(512, 154, 75, 54, 47, 37, 34, 29) for the first binary classification task, and (K1 , . . . , K8 ) =
(491, 143, 74, 49, 36, 32, 28, 26) for the second one. Figs. 1(c)-(d) also show that increasing the
network depth in general improves the performance, but the first-layer width clearly plays an important role in controlling the ultimate network capacity. This insight is further illustrated below.
Feature learning for multi-class classification. We test the PGBNs for multi-class classification
on 20newsgroups. After removing a standard list of stopwords and the terms that appear less than
five times, we obtain a vocabulary with K0 = 33, 420. We set Ct = 500 and η (t) = 0.05 for all
t. If K1 max ≤ 400, we set Bt = 1000 for all t, otherwise we set B1 = 1000 and Bt = 500 for
t ≥ 2. We use all 11,269 training documents to infer a set of networks with Tmax ∈ {1, . . . , 5} and
K1 max ∈ {50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800}, and mimic the same testing procedure used for binary classification to extract low-dimensional feature vectors, with which each testing document is classified
to one of the 20 news groups using the L2 regularized logistic regression. Fig. 2 shows a clear trend
of improvement in classification accuracy by increasing the network depth with a limited first-layer
width, or by increasing the upper bound of the width of the first layer with the depth fixed. For example, a single-layer PGBN with K1 max = 100 could add one or more layers to slightly outperform
a single-layer PGBN with K1 max = 200, and a single-layer PGBN with K1 max = 200 could add
layers to clearly outperform a single-layer PGBN with K1 max as large as 800. We also note that
each iteration of jointly training multiple layers costs moderately more than that of training a single
layer, e.g., with K1 max = 400, a training iteration on a single core of an Intel Xeon 2.7 GHz CPU
on average takes about 5.6, 6.7, 7.1 seconds for the PGBN with 1, 3, and 5 layers, respectively.
Examining the inferred network structure also reveals interesting details.
For example, in a random trial with Algorithm 1, the inferred network widths (K1 , . . . , K5 ) are

Figure 3: (a) per-heldout-word perplexity (the lower the better) for the NIPS12 corpus (using the 2000 most
frequent terms) as a function of the upper bound of the first layer width K1 max and network depth T , with
30% of the word tokens in each document used for training and η (t) = 0.05 for all t. (b) for visualization, each
curve in (a) is reproduced by subtracting its values from the average perplexity of the single-layer network.

(50, 50, 50, 50, 50), (200, 161, 130, 94, 63), (528, 129, 109, 98, 91), and (608, 100, 99, 96, 89), for
K1 max = 50, 200, 600, and 800, respectively. This indicates that for a network with an insufficient
budget on its first-layer width, as the network depth increases, its inferred layer widths decay more
slowly than a network with a sufficient or surplus budget on its first-layer width; and a network with
a surplus budget on its first-layer width may only need relatively small widths for its higher hidden
layers. In the Appendix, we provide comparisons of accuracies between the PGBN and other related
algorithms, including these of [9] and [26], on similar multi-class document classification tasks.
Perplexities for holdout words. In addition to examining the performance of the PGBN for unsupervised feature learning, we also consider a more direct approach that we randomly choose 30% of
the word tokens in each document as training, and use the remaining ones to calculate per-heldoutword perplexity. We consider the NIPS12 (http://www.cs.nyu.edu/∼roweis/data.html) corpus, limiting the vocabulary to the 2000 most frequent terms. We set η (t) = 0.05 and Ct = 500 for all t, set
B1 = 1000 and Bt = 500 for t ≥ 2, and consider five random trials. Among the Bt + Ct Gibbs
sampling iterations used to train layer t, we collect one sample per five iterations during the last 500
(1)
(1)
iterations, for each of which we draw the topics {φk }k and topics weights θ j , to compute the
per-heldout-word perplexity using Equation (34) of [13]. As shown in Fig. 3, we observe a clear
trend of improvement by increasing both K1 max and T .
Qualitative analysis and document simulation. In addition to these quantitative experiments, we
Qt−1 (`)  (t)
have also examined the topics learned at each layer. We use
φk to project topic k of
`=1 Φ
layer t as a V -dimensional word probability vector. Generally speaking, the topics at lower layers
are more specific, whereas those at higher layers are more general. E.g., examining the results used
to produce Fig. 3, with K1 max = 200 and T = 5, the PGBN infers a network with (K1 , . . . , K5 ) =
(200, 164, 106, 60, 42). The ranks (by popularity) and top five words of three example topics for
layer T = 5 are “6 network units input learning training,” “15 data model learning set image,” and
“34 network learning model input neural;” while these of five example topics of layer T = 1 are “19
likelihood em mixture parameters data,” “37 bayesian posterior prior log evidence,” “62 variables
belief networks conditional inference,” “126 boltzmann binary machine energy hinton,” and “127
(T +1) 
speech speaker acoustic vowel phonetic.” We have also tried drawing θ (T ) ∼ Gam r, 1/cj
and downward passing it through the T -layer network to generate synthetic documents, which are
found to be quite interpretable and reflect various general aspects of the corpus used to train the network. We provide in the Appendix a number of synthetic documents generated from a PGBN trained
on the 20newsgroups corpus, whose inferred structure is (K1 , . . . , K5 ) = (608, 100, 99, 96, 89).

Conclusions

The Poisson gamma belief network is proposed to extract a multilayer deep representation for highdimensional count vectors, with an efficient upward-downward Gibbs sampler to jointly train all
its layers and a layer-wise training strategy to automatically infer the network structure. Example
results clearly demonstrate the advantages of deep topic models. For big data problems, in practice
one may rarely has a sufficient budget to allow the first-layer width to grow without bound, thus
it is natural to consider a belief network that can use a deep representation to not only enhance its
representation power, but also better allocate its computational resource. Our algorithm achieves a
good compromise between the widths of hidden layers and the depth of the network.
