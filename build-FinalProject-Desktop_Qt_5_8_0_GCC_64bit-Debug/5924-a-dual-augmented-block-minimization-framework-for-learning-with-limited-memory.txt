Abstract
In past few years, several techniques have been proposed for training of linear
Support Vector Machine (SVM) in limited-memory setting, where a dual blockcoordinate descent (dual-BCD) method was used to balance cost spent on I/O and
computation. In this paper, we consider the more general setting of regularized
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) when data cannot fit into memory. In particular, we generalize the existing block minimization framework based on strong
duality and Augmented Lagrangian technique to achieve global convergence for
general convex ERM. The block minimization framework is flexible in the sense
that, given a solver working under sufficient memory, one can integrate it with
the framework to obtain a solver globally convergent under limited-memory condition. We conduct experiments on L1-regularized classification and regression
problems to corroborate our convergence theory and compare the proposed framework to algorithms adopted from online and distributed settings, which shows superiority of the proposed approach on data of size ten times larger than the memory
capacity.

Introduction

Nowadays data of huge scale are prevalent in many applications of statistical learning and data
mining. It has been argued that model performance can be boosted by increasing both number
of samples and features, and through crowdsourcing technology, annotated samples of terabytes
storage size can be generated [3]. As a result, the performance of model is no longer limited by the
sample size but the amount of available computational resources. In other words, the data size can
easily go beyond the size of physical memory of available machines. Under this setting, most of
learning algorithms become slow due to expensive I/O from secondary storage device [26].
When it comes to huge-scale data, two settings are often considered — online and distributed learning. In the online setting, each sample is processed only once without storage, while in the distributed setting, one has several machines that can jointly fit the data into memory. However, the
real cases are often not as extreme as these two — there are usually machines that can fit part of the
data, but not all of them. In this setting, an algorithm can only process a block of data at a time.
Therefore, balancing the time spent on I/O and computation becomes the key issue [26]. Although
one can employ an online-fashioned learning algorithm in this setting, it has been observed that online method requires large number of epoches to achieve comparable performance to batch method,
and at each epoch it spends most of time on I/O instead of computation [2, 21, 26]. The situation
for online method could become worse for problem of non-smooth, non-strongly convex objective
function, where a qualitatively slower convergence of online method is exhibited [15, 16] than that
proved for strongly-convex problem like SVM [14].
In the past few years, several algorithms have been proposed to solve large-scale linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) in the limited memory setting [2, 21, 26]. These approaches are based on a dual
1

Block Coordinate Descent (dual-BCD) algorithim, which decomposes the original problem into a
series of block sub-problems, each of them requires only a block of data loaded into memory. The
approach was proved linearly convergent to the global optimum, and demonstrated fast convergence
empirically. However, the convergence of the algorithm relies on the assumption of a smooth dual
problem, which, as we show, does not hold generally for other regularized Empirical Risk Minimizaton (ERM) problem. As a result, although the dual-BCD approach can be extended to the more
general setting, it is not globally convergent except for a class of problems with L2-regularizer.
In this paper, we first show how to adapt the dual block-coordinate descnet method of [2, 26] to
the general setting of regularized Empirical Risk Mimization (ERM), which subsumes most of supervised learning problems ranging from classification, regression to ranking and recommendation.
Then we discuss the convergence issue arises when the underlying ERM is not strongly-convex. A
Primal Proximal Point ( or Dual Augmented Lagrangian ) method is then proposed to address this
issue, which as we show, results in a block minimization algorithm with global convergence to optimum for convex regularized ERM problems. The framework is flexible in the sense that, given a
solver working under sufficient-memory condition, it can be integrated into the block minimization
framework to obtain a solver globally convergent under limited-memory condition.
We conduct experiments on L1-regularized classification and regression problems to corroborate
our convergence theory, which shows that the proposed simple dual-augmented technique changes
the convergence behavior dramatically. We also compare the proposed framework to algorithms
adopted from online and distributed settings. In particular, we describe how to adapt a distributed optimization framework — Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) [1] — to the limitedmemory setting, and show that, although the adapted algorithm is effective, it is not as efficient as the
proposed framework specially designed for limited-memory setting. Note our experiment does not
adapt into comparison some recently proposed distributed learning algorithms (CoCoA etc.) [7, 10]
that only apply to ERM with L2-regularizer or some other distributed method designed for some
specific loss function [19].

Problem Setup

In this work, we consider the regularized Empirical Risk Minimization problem, which given a data
set D = {(Φn , y n )}N
n=1 , estimates a model through

min

w∈Rd ,ξn ∈Rp

s.t.

F (w, ξ) = R(w) +

N
X
n=1

Ln (ξ n )

(1)

Φn w = ξ n , n ∈ [N ]

where w ∈ Rd is the model parameter to be estimated, Φn is a p by d design matrix that encodes
features of the n-th data sample, Ln (ξ n ) is a convex loss function that penalizes the discrepancy
between ground truth and prediction vector ξ n ∈ Rp , and R(w) is a convex regularization term
penalizing model complexity.
The formulation (1) subsumes a large class of statistical learning problems ranging from classification [27], regression [17], ranking [8], and convex clustering [24]. For example, in classification
problem, we have p = |Y| where YPconsists of the set of all possible labels and Ln (ξ) can be defined
as the logistic loss Ln (ξ) = log( k∈Y exp(ξk )) − ξyn as in logistic regression or the hinge loss
Ln (ξ) = maxk∈Y (1 − δk,yn + ξk − ξyn ) as used in support vector machine; in a (multi-task) regression problem, the target variable consists of K real values Y = RK , the prediction vector has p = K
dimensions, and a square loss Ln (ξ) = 21 kξ−y n k22 is often used. There are also a variety of regularizers R(w) employed in different applications, which includes the L2-regularizer R(w) = λ2 kwk2
in ridge regression, L1-regularizer R(w) = λkwk1 in Lasso, nuclear-norm R(w) = λkwk∗ in
matrix completion, and a family of structured group norms R(w) = λkwkG [11]. Although the
specific form of Ln (ξ), R(w) does not affect the implementation of the limited-memory training
procedure, two properties of the functions — strong convexity and smoothness — have key effects
on the behavior of the block minimization algorithm.
2

Definition 1 (Strong Convexity). A function f (x) is strongly convex iff it is lower bounded by a
simple quadratic function
m
f (y) ≥ f (x) + ∇f (x)T (y − x) + kx − yk2
(2)
2
for some constant m > 0 and ∀x, y ∈ dom(f ).
Definition 2 (Smoothness). A function f (x) is smooth iff it is upper bounded by a simple quadratic
function
M
f (y) ≤ f (x) + ∇f (x)T (y − x) +
kx − yk2
(3)
2
for some constant 0 ≤ M < ∞ and ∀x, y ∈ dom(f ).
For instance, the square loss and logistic loss are both smooth and strongly convex 1 , while the hingeloss satisfies neither of them. On the other hand, most of regularizers such as L1-norm, structured
group norm, and nuclear norm are neither smooth nor strongly convex, except for the L2-regularizer,
which satifies both. In the following we will demonstrate the effects of these properties to Block
Minimization algorithms.
Throughout this paper, we will assume that a solver for (1) that works in sufficient-memory condition
is given, and our task is to design an algorithmic framework that integrates with the solver to efficiently solve (1) when data cannot fit into memory. We will assume, however, that the d-dimensional
parameter vector w can be fit into memory.

Dual Block Minimization

In this section, we extend the block minimization framework of [26] from linear SVM to the general
setting of regularized ERM (1).The dual of (1) can be expressed as
min

µ∈Rd ,αn ∈Rp

R∗ (−µ) +

L∗n (αn )

n=1
N
X

s.t.

N
X

ΦTn αn

(4)

=µ

n=1

where R∗ (−µ) is the convex conjugate of R(w) and L∗n (αn ) is the convex conjugate of Ln (ξ n ).
The block minimization algorithm of [26] basically performs a dual Block-Coordinate Descent
(dual-BCD) over (4) by dividing the whole data set D into K blocks DB1 , ..., DBK , and optimizing a block of dual variables (αBk , µ) at a time, where DBk = {(Φn , y n )}n∈Bk and
αBk = {αn |n ∈ Bk }.
In [26], the dual problem (4) is derived explicitly in order to perform the algorithm. However,
for many sparsity-inducing regularizer such as L1-norm and nuclear norm, it is more efficient and
convenient to solve (1) in the primal [6, 28]. Therefore, here instead of explicitly forming the dual
problem, we express it implicitly as
G(α) = min L(α, w, ξ),
(5)
w,ξ

where L(α, w, ξ) is the Lagrangian function of (1), and maximize (5) w.r.t. a block of variables
αBk from the primal instead of dual by strong duality

in the beginning of solving each block subproblem (7). Since subproblem (7) is of the same form to
the original problem (1) except for one additional linear augmented term µTBk w, one can adapt the
solver of (1) to solve (7) easily by providing an augmented version of the gradient
∇w F̄ (w, ξ) = ∇w F (w, ξ) + µtBk
to the solver, where F̄ (.) denotes the function with augmented terms and F (.) denotes the function
without augmented terms. Note the augmented term µtBk is constant and separable w.r.t. coordinates, so it adds little overhead to the solver. After obtaining solution (w∗ , ξ ∗Bk ) from (7), we can
derive the corresponding optimal dual variables αBk for (6) according to the KKT condition and
maintain µ subsequently by

The procedure is summarized in Algorithm 1, which requires a total memory capacity of O(d +
|DBk | + p|Bk |). The factor d comes from the storage of µt , wt , factor |DBk | comes from the
storage of data block, and the factor p|Bk | comes from the storage of αBk . Note this requires the
same space complexity as that required in the original algorithm proposed for linear SVM [26],
where p = 1 for the binary classification setting.

Dual-Augmented Block Minimization

The Block Minimization Algorithm 1, though can be applied to the general regularized ERM problem (1), it is not guaranteed that the sequence {αt }∞
t=0 produced by Algorithm 1 converges to global
optimum of (1). In fact, the global convergence of Algorithm 1 only happens for some special cases.
One sufficient condition for the global convergence of a Block-Coordinate Descent algorithm is that
the terms in objective function that are not separable w.r.t. blocks must be smooth (Definition 2).
The dual objective function (4) (expressed using only α) comprises two terms
PN
PN
R∗ (− n=1 ΦTn αn ) + n=1 L∗n (αn ), where second term is separable w.r.t. to {αn }N
n=1 ,
K
and thus is also separable w.r.t. {αBk }k=1 , while the first term couples variables αB1 , ..., αBK
involving all the blocks. As a result, if R∗ (−µ) is a smooth function according to Definition 2, then
Algorithm 1 has global convergence to the optimum. However, the following theorem states this is
true only when R(w) is strongly convex.
Theorem 1 (Strong/Smooth Duality). Assume f (.) is closed and convex. Then f (.) is smooth with
1
parameter M if and only if its convex conjugate f ∗ (.) is strongly convex with parameter m = M
.
A proof of above theorem can be found in [9]. According to Theorem 1, the Block Minimization
Algorithm 1 is not globally convergent if R(w) is not strongly convex, which however, is the case
for most of regularizers other than the L2-norm R(w) = 21 kwk2 , as discussed in Section 2.
In this section, we propose a remedy to this problem, which by a Dual-Augmented Lagrangian
method (or equivalently, Primal Proximal Point method), creates a dual objective function of desired
property that iteratively approaches the original objective (1), and results in fast global convergence
of the dual-BCD approach.

The Dual Augmented Lagrangian (DAL) method (or equivalently, Proximal Point Method) modifies
the original problem by introducing a sequence of Proximal Maps

(11)

where F (w) denotes the ERM problem (1) Under this simple modification, instead of doing BlockCoordinate Descent in the dual of original problem (1), we perform Dual-BCD on the proximal subproblem (11). As we show in next section, the dual formulation of (11) has the required property
for global convergence of the Dual BCD algorithm — all terms involving more than one block of
variables αBk are smooth. Given the current iterate wt , the Dual-Augmented Block Minimization
algorithm optimizes the dual of proximal-point problem (11) w.r.t. one block of variables αBk at a
(t,s)
time, keeping others fixed {αBj = αBj }j6=k :

The sub-problem (14) is of similar form to the original ERM problem (1). Since the augmented
term is a simple quadratic function separable w.r.t. each coordinate, given a solver for (1) working
in sufficient-memory condition, one can easily adapt it by modifying
∇w F̄ (w, ξ) = ∇w F (w, ξ) + µtBk + (w − wt )/ηt
∇2w F̄ (w, ξ) = ∇2w F (w, ξ) + I/ηt ,
where F̄ (.) denotes the function with augmented terms and F (.) denotes the function without augmented terms. The Block Minimization procedure is repeated until every sub-problem (14) reaches
a tolerance in . Then the proximal point method update wt+1 = w∗ (α(t,s) ) is performed, where
w∗ (α(t,s) ) is the solution of (14) for the latest dual iterate α(t,s) . The resulting algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2.
4.2

Analysis

In this section, we analyze the convergence rate of Algorithm 2 to the optimum of (1). First, we
show that the proximal-point formulation (11) has a dual problem with desired property for the
global convergence of Block-Coordinate Descent. In particular, since the dual of (11) takes the form
minp

αn ∈R

where R̃∗ (.) is the convex conjugate of R̃(w) = R(w)+ 2η1 t kw −wt k2 , and since R̃(w) is strongly
convex with parameter m = 1/ηt , the convex conjugate R̃∗ (.) is smooth with parameter M = ηt
according to Theorem 1. Therefore, (18) is in the composite form of a convex, smooth function plus
a convex, block-separable function. This type of function has been widely studied in the literature
of Block-Coordinate Descent [13]. In particular, one can show that a Block-Coordinate Descent
applied on (18) has global convergence to optimum with a fast rate by the following theorem.
Theorem 2 (BCD Convergence). Let the sequence {αs }∞
s=1 be the iterates produced by Block
Coordinate Descent in the inner loop of Algorithm 2, and K be the number of blocks. Denote F̃ ∗ (α)

the optimal value of (18). Then with probability 1−ρ,

for some constant β > 0 if (i) Ln (.) is smooth, or (ii) Ln (.) is polyhedral function and R(.) is also

for some constant c > 0.
Note the above analysis (in appendix) does not assume exact solution of each block subproblem.
Instead, it only assumes each block minimization step leads to a dual ascent amount proportional to
that produced by a single (dual) proximal gradient ascent step on the block of dual variables. For
the outer loop of Primal Proximal-Point (or Dual Augmented Lagrangian) iterates (11), we show the
following convergence theorem.
Theorem 3 (Proximal Point Convergence). Let F (w) be objective of the regularized ERM problem
(1), and R = maxv maxw {kv − wk : F (w) ≤ F (w0 ), F (v) ≤ F (w0 )} be the radius of initial
level set. The sequence {wt }∞
t=1 produced by the Proximal-Point update (11) with ηt = η has
ω
F (wt+1 ) − Fopt ≤ , for t ≥ τ log( ).
(21)

for some constant τ, ω > 0 if both Ln (.) and R(.) are (i) strictly convex and smooth or (ii) polyhedral. Otherwise, for any convex F (w) we have
F (wt+1 ) − Fopt ≤ R2 /(2ηt).

The following theorem further shows that solving sub-problem (11) inexactly with tolerance /t
suffices for convergence to  overall precision, where t is the number of outer iterations required.
Theorem 4 (Inexact Proximal Map). Suppose, for a given dual iterate wt , each sub-problem (11)
is solved inexactly s.t. the solution ŵt+1 has
kŵt+1 − proxηt F (wt )k ≤ 0 .

as that generated by exact updates. After t iterations, we have

Note for Ln (.), R(.) being strictly convex and smooth, or polyhedral, t is of order O(log(1/)),
and thus it only requires O(K log(1/) log(t/)) = O(K log2 (1/)) overall number of block minimization steps to achieve  suboptimality. Otherwise, as long as Ln (.) is smooth, for any convex
regularizer R(.), t is of order O(1/), so it requires O(K(1/) log(t/)) = O( K log(1/)


number of block minimization steps.
4.3

Practical Issues

4.3.1 Solving Sub-Problem Inexactly
While the analysis in Section 4.2 assumes exact solution of subproblems, in practice, the Block
Minimization framework does not require solving subproblem (11), (14) exactly. In our experiments,
it suffices for the fast convergence of proximal-point update (11) to solve subproblem (14) for only a
single pass of all blocks of variables αB1 ,..., αBK , and limit the number of iterations the designated
solver spends on each subproblem (7), (14) to be no more than some parameter Tmax .
4.3.2 Random Selection w/o Replacement
In Algorithm 1 and 2, the block to be optimized is chosen uniformly at random from k ∈ {1, ..., K},
which eases the analysis for proving a better convergence rate [13]. However, in practice, to avoid
unbalanced update frequency among blocks, we do random sampling without replacement for both
Algorithm 1 and 2, that is, for every K iterations, we generate a random permutation π1 , ..., πK of
block index 1, .., K and optimize block subproblems (7), (14) according to the order π1 , .., πK . This
also eases the checking of inner-loop stopping condition.
4.3.3 Storage of Dual Variables
Both the algorithms 1 and 2 need to store the dual variables αBk into memory and load/save them
from/to some secondary storage units, which requires a time linear to p|Bk |. For some problems,
such as multi-label classification with large number of labels or structured prediction with large
number of factors, this can be very expensive. In this situation, one can instead maintain µB̄k =
P
T
n∈Bk Φn αn = µ − µBk directly. Note µB̄k has I/O and storage cost linear to d, which can be
much smaller than p|Bk | in a low-dimensional problem.

Experiment

In this section, we compare the proposed Dual Augmented Block Minimization framework (Algorithm 2) to the vanilla Dual Block Coordinate Descent algorithm [26] and methods adopted from
Online and Distributed Learning. The experiments are conducted on the problem of L1-regularized
L2-loss SVM [27] and the (Lasso) (L1-regularized Regression) problem [17] in the limited-memory
setting with data size 10 times larger than the available memory. For both problems, we use stateof-the-art randomized coordinate descent method [13, 27] as the solver for solving sub-problems
(7), (14), (59), (63), and we set parameter ηt = 1, λ = 1 (of L1-regularizer) for all experiments.
Four public benchmark data sets are used— webspam, rcv1-binary for classification and year-pred,
E2006 for regression, which can be obtained from the LIBSVM data set collections. For year-pred
and E2006, the features are generated from Random Fourier Features [12, 23] that approximate the
effect of Gaussian RBF kernel. Table 1 summarizes the data statistics. The algorithms in comparison and their shorthands are listed below, where all solvers are implemented in C/C++ and run on
64-bit machine with 2.83GHz Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU. We constrained the process to use no more
than 1/10 of memory required to store the whole data.

• D-BCD2 : Dual Block-Coordinate Descent method (Algorithm 1).
• DA-BCD: Dual-Augmented Block Minimization (Algorithm 2).
• ADMM: ADMM for limited-memory learning (Algorithm 3 in appendix-B).
• BC-ADMM: Block-Coordinate ADMM that updates a randomly chosen block of dual variables at a time for limited-memory learning (Algorithm 4 in appendix-B) .
We use wall clock time that includes both I/O and computation as measure for training time in all
experiments. In Figure 5, three measures are plotted versus the training time: Relative objective
function difference to the optimum, Testing RMSE and Accuracy. Figure 5 shows the results, where
as expected, the dual Block Coordinate Descent (D-BCD) method without augmentation cannot improve the objective after certain number of iterations. However, with extremely simple modification,
the Dual-Augmented Block Minimization (DA-BCD) algorithm becomes not only globally convergent but with a rate several times faster than other approaches. Among all methods, the convergence
of Online Mirror Descent (SMIDAS) is significantly slower, which is expected since (i) the online
Mirror Descent on a non-smooth, non-strongly convex function converges at a rate qualitatively
slower than the linear convergence rate of DA-BCD and ADMM [15, 16], and (ii) Online method
does not utilize the available memory capacity and thus spends unbalanced time on I/O and computation. For methods adopted from distributed optimization, the experiment shows BC-ADMM
consistently, but only slightly, improves ADMM, and both of them converge much slower than the
DA-BCD approach, presumably due to the conservative updates on the dual variables.

The objective value obtained from D-BCD fluctuates a lot, in figures we plot the lowest values achieved by
D-BCD from the beginning to time t.
