<B>Abstract</B> 
<P>
General self-efficacy is measured by a widely used parsimonious
ten-item scale that was developed for use in several cultures.
The present paper compares the versions that were examined in
samples of 430 German, 959 Costa Rican, and 293 Chinese university
students. The internal consistencies were .84, .81, and .91, respectively.
The unidimensional nature of the scale was replicated in all samples.
Multilingual item-pattern equivalence was only moderately supported
by confirmatory factor analyses. Mean differences of sum scores
between languages were found. Moreover, an interaction between
gender and language emerged. Correlations with depression, anxiety,
and optimism provided some further evidence for construct validity.

<H2>The Assessment of Optimistic Self-Beliefs: Comparison of the
German, Spanish, and Chinese Versions of the General Self-Efficacy
Scale </H2>

<P>
The present article first introduces the theoretical construct
of self-efficacy and then describes a brief scale that is designed
to measure this construct at the level of a general personality
disposition. The original German instrument has been proven reliable
and valid in various field studies which are described elsewhere
(Schwarzer, 1993). The scale has been translated into many languages,
but so far empirical data sets are available only for the German,
Spanish and Chinese versions. This paper compares the psychometric
properties for these three versions and examines the cross-language
equivalence of the instrument. The purpose of the present study
is twofold: to examine whether the theoretical construct of perceived
self-efficacy is universal, and to attain psychometrically sound
adaptations of the inventory that can be used with Spanish- and
Chinese-speaking populations.
<P>
<h3><U>The Construct of Perceived Self-Efficacy</U> </h3>
<P>
Human functioning is facilitated by a personal sense of control.
If people believe that they can take action to solve a problem
instrumentally, they become more inclined to do so and feel more
committed to this decision. The construct of self-efficacy was
introduced by Bandura and represents one core aspect of his social-cognitive
theory (Bandura, 1977, 1995a, 1995b). While outcome expectancies
refer to the perception of the possible consequences of one's
action, self-efficacy expectancies refer to personal action control
or agency. A person who believes in being able to cause an event
can conduct a more active and self-determined life course. This
&quot;can do&quot;-cognition mirrors a sense of control over one's
environment. It reflects the belief of being able to control challenging
environmental demands by means of taking adaptive action. It can
be regarded as a self-confident view of one's capability to deal
with certain life stressors.
<P>
According to theory and research (Bandura, 1995a, 1995b), self-efficacy
makes a difference in how people feel, think and act. In terms
of feeling, a low sense of self-efficacy is associated with depression,
anxiety, and helplessness. Such individuals also have low self-esteem
and harbor pessimistic thoughts about their accomplishments and
personal development. In terms of thinking, a strong sense of
competence facilitates cognitive processes and performance in
a variety of settings, including quality of decision-making and
academic achievement. When it comes to preparing action, self-related
cognitions are a major ingredient of the motivation process. Self-efficacy
levels can enhance or impede motivation. People with high self-efficacy
choose to perform more challenging tasks. They set themselves
higher goals and stick to them. Actions are preshaped in thought,
and people anticipate either optimistic or pessimistic scenarios
in line with their level of self-efficacy. Once an action has
been taken, high self-efficacious persons invest more effort and
persist longer than those who are low in self-efficacy. When setbacks
occur, they recover more quickly and maintain the commitment to
their goals. Self-efficacy also allows people to select challenging
settings, explore their environments, or create new environments.
<P>
A sense of competence can be acquired by mastery experience, vicarious
experience, verbal persuasion, or physiological feedback. Self-efficacy,
however, is not the same as positive illusions or unrealistic
optimism since it is based on experience and does not lead to
unreasonable risk taking. Instead, it leads to venturesome behavior
that is within reach of one's capabilities.
<P>
Self-referent thought has become an issue that pervades psychological
research in many domains. It has been found that a strong sense
of personal efficacy is related to better health, higher achievement,
and more social integration. This concept has been applied to
such diverse areas as school achievement, emotional disorders,
mental and physical health, career choice, and sociopolitical
change. It has become a key variable in clinical, educational,
social, developmental, health, and personality psychology (Bandura,
1995a, 1995b; Maddux, 1994; Schwarzer, 1992).
<P>
<h3><U>The General Self-Efficacy Scale</U> </h3>
<P>
Self-efficacy is commonly understood as domain-specific; that
is, one can have more or less firm self-beliefs in different domains
or particular situations of functioning. But some researchers
have also conceptualized a generalized sense of self-efficacy.
It refers to a global confidence in one's coping ability across
a wide range of demanding or novel situations. Snyder and collaborators
(1991) suggested such a construct that they coined &quot;hope.&quot;
They defined hope as a cognitive set that is composed of a reciprocally
derived sense of successful agency and pathways. Agency reflects
goal-directed determination, whereas pathways refers to planning
of ways to meet goals. Agency resembles self-efficacy, whereas
pathways resembles outcome expectancies. Skinner, Chapman, and
Baltes (1988) have made a similar distinction between agency beliefs
and means-ends-beliefs. Other conceptions of generalized self-efficacy
have been proposed by Sherer and Maddux (1982) and Wallston (1992).
In contrast to dispositional optimism (Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985,
1992), the theoretical advantage of generalized self-efficacy
lies in the explicit assumptions about the causal underpinnings
of one's positive outlook on life. Dispositional optimism includes
all kinds of causes, external and internal, and even chance. Generalized
self-efficacy, however, is restricted to one's personal resource
beliefs, focussing on competence and disregarding other sources
or reasons for optimism (for a detailed discussion of the optimism
construct see Schwarzer, 1994).
<P>
The general self-efficacy scale aims at a broad and stable sense
of personal competence to deal effectively with a variety of stressful
situations. The German version of this scale was originally developed
by Jerusalem and Schwarzer in 1981, first as a 20-item version
and later as a reduced 10-item version (Jerusalem &amp; Schwarzer,
1986, 1992; Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1989). It has been used
in numerous research projects, where it typically yielded internal
consistencies between alpha = .75 and .90. The scale is not only
parsimonious and reliable, it has also proven valid in terms of
convergent and discriminant validity. For example, it correlates
positively with self-esteem and optimism, and negatively with
anxiety, depression and physical symptoms. Previous studies are
described in the manual (Schwarzer, 1993), which includes not
only the scale in English, German, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Hungarian,
Turkish, Czech, and Slovak, but also the results of five studies
conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the German
version. Also, norms (<U>T</U> scores) based on a sample of 1,660
German adults are available. The manual describes, among others,
retest reliabilities over one- and two-year periods and different
kinds of validity, such as experimental, criterion-related and
predictive validity. All coefficients turned out to be very satisfactory.
<P>
The inventory, however, cannot be used as a substitute for domain-specific
self-efficacy. Rather, scales should be tailored to the spheres
of functioning being explored wherever possible. A distinction
could be made here between exploratory and confirmatory research.
In innovative large-scale field studies governed by a broad range
of variables and few specific hypotheses, general constructs have
been found useful. An example is our exploratory study on East
Germans who migrated to the West when the Berlin wall came down:
Over a two-year observation period, initial generalized self-efficacy
turned out to be the best single predictor of overall adjustment,
as assessed by a number of health and well-being variables (Schwarzer,
Hahn, &amp; Schr&ouml;der, 1994; Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995).
In that case, the unique research context did not allow closer
examination of a variety of domain-specific coping outcomes with
corresponding specific measures of self-efficacy, although this
would have been desirable.
<P>
There is typically a better prediction by specific scales if the
criterion variables are also measured in a specific manner. For
example, if coping with a spider phobia or a math problem is at
stake, domain-specific measures of perceived self-efficacy are
better predictors of outcomes than generalized ones. In contrast,
if trait anxiety, depression, or similar global constructs are
to be predicted, generalized constructs are more adequate (Schwarzer,
1993).
<P>
<h3><U>Research Question</U> </h3>
<P>
The present study aims at examining the psychometric properties
of three versions of the General Self-Efficacy Scale. This is
done with the assumption that self-efficacy is a universal construct
that applies to different cultures and can be measured by inventories
in different languages. The purpose is to confirm this assumption
and provide measures that can be adopted in other countries for
collecting further evidence. Three steps are taken to obtain the
necessary psychometric data: First, the internal structure of
the instrument is scrutinized, which includes item analyses, principal
component analyses, and a confirmatory factor analysis to test
the equivalence across languages. Second, mean differences between
languages and gender are analyzed. Third, the construct validity
is further explored by correlations with different psychological
constructs.
<P>
<h2><B>Method</B> </h2>
<P>
<h3><U>Scale Adaptations</U></h3> 1)
<P>
The original <U>German</U> version of the General Self-Efficacy
Scale has been found reliable and valid in numerous studies (Schwarzer,
1993). While previously only a few university students had been
part of the sample, the present study includes a new data set
of students. Appendix A contains the German version (see Appendix
D for the English version of the scale).
<P>
The <U>Spanish</U> adaptation (see Appendix B) was based on the
German and English versions of the instrument. The adaptation
procedure followed the &quot;group consensus model&quot; of several
bilingual translators and included a series of back translations
and discussions. The aim was not to achieve a literal translation
of each item, but rather an adaptation of the construct of self-efficacy.
Each item was supposed to include the notion of one's confidence
in the personal competence to cope with adverse events.
<P>
It was not quite clear whether the <U>Chinese</U> adaptation (Appendix
C; based on the English version) would be successful because self-efficacy
is an imported &quot;Western&quot; psychological construct, or
whether it would be superior to other more indigenous constructs
(Bond, 1991; Cheung et al., in press). There is some evidence,
however, that it is useful in research on Chinese people. Earley
and Christopher (1993, 1994), for example, have studied the self-efficacy
of Chinese managers.
<P>
<h3><U>Other Measures</U> </h3>
<P>
The German and Spanish questionnaires contained identical sets
of variables that also included measures for depression, anxiety,
and optimism. As a measure of <U>depression</U>, a 16-item depression
scale was selected (Zerssen, 1976), with items such as &quot;I
feel simply miserable&quot; (a = .79). <U>Anxiety</U> was measured
by four items taken from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI;
Spielberger, 1983), which yielded a = .74 in the present sample.
Dispositional <U>optimism</U> was measured with the eight-item
Life Orientation Test (LOT; Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985), which
contains statements such as &quot;In uncertain times I usually
expect the best&quot; (a = .82).
<P>
<h3><U>Samples</U> </h3>
<P>
The <U>German</U> sample consisted of 430 university students
who studied different subjects at two universities in Berlin.
There were 250 women with an average age of 23.1 years (<U>SD</U>
= 4.2) and 180 men with an average age of 24.2 years (<U>SD</U>
= 4.4). The age difference was statistically significant (<U>F</U>[1,
428] = 7.76, <U>p</U> &lt; .01). The <U>Spanish</U>-speaking sample
consisted of 959 university students from Costa Rica, including
605 women with an average age of 21.3 years (<U>SD</U> = 6.9)
and 354 men with an average age of 21.0 years (<U>SD</U> = 6.3).
There was no significant age difference between women and men.
The <U>Chinese</U> version was given to 293 first-year undergraduate
students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. These students
attended three introductory classes on general psychology, but
most of the students did not choose psychology as their major.
There were 94 male students with an average age of 19.7 years
(<U>SD</U> = 1.4) and 199 female students with an average age
of 19.5 years (<U>SD</U> = 1.4). There was no significant age
difference between women and men. Across languages, significant
age differences emerged, with the Chinese being the youngest and
the Germans being the oldest. This should not have affected the
findings because there was no correlation between age and self-efficacy.
<P>
<h3><U>Procedure</U> </h3>
<P>
In all three studies, the ten self-efficacy items were randomly
inserted in a questionnaire that assessed a number of other constructs
to prevent students from recognizing the purpose of the items.
The data collection was anonymous. There was no compensation for
filling out the questionnaire. The <U>German</U> data were collected
in Berlin in 1993. Administering the entire questionnaire took
about half an hour. The data for the <U>Spanish</U> version were
collected in 1993 in San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica. This was the
same questionnaire as the German one and took about the same time
to fill out. The <U>Chinese</U> data were collected in 1994 in
Hong Kong. The self-efficacy items were randomly inserted in a
questionnaire that assessed political stress and healthy nutrition,
a total of 35 items that took about five to ten minutes to complete.
<P>
<h3><B>Results</B> </h3>
<P>
The results section will focus first on the internal structure
of the instrument to assess the psychometric properties for each
of the three language versions. Then, mean differences and further
evidence for validity will be examined.
<P>
<h3><U>Item Characteristics and Reliability</U> </h3>
<P>
Item analyses were carried out separately for each version of
the scale. Each item had a response range from one to four. Item
means and corrected item-total correlations are given in Table
1. All coefficients turned out to be satisfactory. No improvement
was possible by eliminating items. The internal consistency of
Cronbach's alpha = .91 was excellent for the Chinese version.
Those of .84 and .81 for the German and Spanish versions were
satisfactory, considering that the scale contained only ten items.
<P>
<I>------- Insert Table 1 about here -------</I> 
<P>
<h3><U>Principal Components Analyses</U> </h3>
<P>
In previous German studies the scale was homogeneous. To study
this scale characteristic, a principal components analysis was
computed separately for each language version. In the <U>German</U>
sample, the first three eigenvalues were 4.06, 0.96, and 0.82.
Thus, only one general factor was extracted that accounted for
41% of the total variance. For the <U>Spanish</U> version, the
first three eigenvalues were 3.91, 1.00, and 0.90. A one-factor
solution with 39% of variance accounted for was suitable. In the
<U>Chinese</U> sample, the first three eigenvalues were 5.49,
0.84, and 0.74. Again, this was a replication of unidimensionality
with the first factor accounting for 55% of the variance.
<P>
<h3><U>Psychometric Equivalence of the Instrument Across Languages</U></h3>

<P>
It was demonstrated that the scale was reliable as well as homogeneous
or unidimensional in all three versions. This indicates a certain
degree of cross-language psychometric equivalence. However, the
degree to which equivalence is given depends also on the constraints
that are imposed upon the comparison procedure. If the aim is
to construct an instrument that is equivalent on an item-by-item
basis, it is necessary to test the congruence of the item pattern
across groups. This can be performed by multigroup confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA). A very constrained model uses the parameter
estimates for the first sample as a standard and holds only if
the parameters of the other two groups do not differ from this
standard (Hocevar &amp; El-Zahhar, 1985, 1992).
<P>
The model was tested with the LISREL 8 program (J&ouml;reskog
&amp; S&ouml;rbom, 1993). Input was a correlation matrix of the
ten observed variables for each culture. Accordingly, the parameters
were estimated by the unweighted least squares method. The model
fit was evaluated in terms of chi-square, root mean square residuals
(RMR), and various goodness of fit indices. The chi-square divided
by the degrees of freedom can be seen as a less biased fit estimate
(c2/<U>df</U>) than the chi-square itself because it is dependent
on sample size. This quotient should be small, and values below
three are considered to be satisfactory (Bentler, 1980; Bollen,
1989; Bollen &amp; Long, 1993; Byrne, 1990). The root mean square
residual should be very small with values below .05 being desirable.
The goodness of fit index (GFI) should be above .92. The same
applies to the adjusted GFI (AGFI; adjusted for degrees of freedom).
These are rough fit indicators only. A more comprehensive assessment
includes further fit indices as well as a careful inspection of
the parameter estimates, accounted variance, and modification
indices.
<P>
First, a one-dimension confirmatory factor analysis was computed
for each sample. This yielded the factor loadings in the first
three columns of Table 2.
<P>
<I>------- Insert Table 2 here -------</I> 
<P>
The fit indices turned out to be excellent, which confirmed the
unidimensionality of the instrument. For the <U>German</U> sample
the fit was chi-2 = 31.56 (35 <U>df</U>, <U>p</U> = .64), chi-2/ <U>df
</U>= .90, RMR = .037, GFI = .99, and AGFI = .99. For the <U>Spanish</U>
version the fit was c2 = 59.53 (35 <U>df</U>, <U>p</U> = .006),
c2/<U>df</U> = 1.70, RMR = .033, GFI = .99, and AGFI = .99. Although
the c2 value was significant here, the model still fit very well.
The obvious reason for this undesirable significance is the large
sample size of the Costa Rican student group. For the <U>Chinese</U>
sample the fit was c2 = 27.09 (35 <U>df</U>, <U>p</U> = .83),
c2/<U>df</U> = .77, RMR = .041, GFI = .99, and AGFI = .99.
<P>
So far, this CFA replicated the above principal component analyses
at a more sophisticated level. The main purpose for application
of CFA, however, was the very strict test of cross-language equivalence
which was done by a multigroup analysis. The German sample data
were given as the standard because the instrument was originally
developed in German, and its validity is mainly given by studies
with that particular version. The other two data sets were constrained
to produce identical unweighted least squares parameter estimates.
That is, technically the lambda X and theta delta matrices were
to be the same as for the first group if this model holds (invariance
assumption). The goodness of fit for the constrained three-group
model turned out to be c2 = 583.3 (145 <U>df</U>, <U>p</U> &lt;
.001), c2/<U>df</U> = 4.01, RMR = .15, and GFI = .93. This is
clearly less favorable than the fit for the three separate models
above. It indicates that the assumption of an item-by-item cross-cultural
equivalence is not very well supported by the data.
<P>
By the same procedure, a common metric was provided. The factor
loadings for the ten items, for the three groups combined, are
given in column 4 of Table 2.
<P>
<h3><U>Scale Characteristics</U> </h3>
<P>
The ten-item sum score had a theoretical range from 10 to 40,
due to the 1 to 4 response format. For the <U>German</U> version
the mean was 27.8 (<U>SD</U> = 4.5, <U>N</U> = 420). The distribution
was somewhat negatively skewed (skewness = -.49), and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test indicated deviations from normality (<U>z</U> = 2.02, <U>p</U>
&lt; .01). The mean in the <U>Costa Rican</U> sample was 33.2
(<U>SD</U> = 4.43, <U>N</U> = 943), also with a skewed distribution
(skewness = -.71, <U>z</U> = 2.78, <U>p</U> &lt;.01). For the
<U>Chinese</U> version the mean was 24.56 and the standard deviation
was 5.31 (<U>N</U> = 293). The sum scores were normally distributed
according to the one-sample test by Kolmogorov-Smirnov (<U>z</U>
= .98, <U>p</U> = .30). Figure 1 depicts the relative frequency
distributions for the three samples.

<P>
<h3><U>Language and Gender Differences</U> </h3>
<P>
There are obviously mean differences between these three data
sets in terms of culture and gender. A two-way factorial analysis
of variance (three levels of language and two levels of gender)
was computed to determine these effects. Due to some missing values,
the analysis was based on only 1,653 persons. Table 3 contains
the cell means, standard deviations, and cell sizes.
<P>
<I>------- Insert Table 3 here -------</I> 
<P>
There was a significant main effect for language (<U>F</U>[2,
1647] = 400.39, <U>p</U> &lt;.001, partial eta2 = .33), a significant
main effect for gender (<U>F</U>[1, 1647] = 45.04, <U>p</U> &lt;.001,
partial eta2 = .03), and a significant interaction effect (<U>F</U>[2,
1647] = 10.47, <U>p</U> &lt;.001, partial eta2 = .01). Significant
gender differences emerged in the Chinese sample (<U>t</U> = 5.1,
<U>df</U> = 291, <U>p</U> &lt; .01) and in the German sample (<U>t</U>
= 3.8, <U>df</U> = 417, <U>p</U> &lt; .01), but not in the Costa
Rican sample (<U>t</U> = 1.3, <U>df</U> = 939, <U>p</U> = .20).
Figure 2 illustrates that women in Hong Kong and Germany obtained
on the average lower self-efficacy scores than men. It also shows
that Costa Rican students attained the highest mean levels and
Hong Kongese students the lowest.
<P>
<I>------- Insert Figure 2 about here -------</I> 
<P>
<h3><U>Validity</U> </h3>
<P>
Self-efficacy in the German sample correlated with depression
<U>r</U> = -.52, anxiety <U>r</U> = -.60, and optimism <U>r</U>
= .55. In the Costa Rican sample it was associated with the same
variables <U>r</U> = -.42, <U>r</U> = -.43, and <U>r</U> = .57,
respectively. This pattern of correlations indicates sufficient
discriminant validity and is in line with self-efficacy theory
(Bandura, 1995a). Depression and anxiety as negative emotional
traits need to be associated negatively with self-efficacy. Individuals
who trust their competence to deal with adverse events cannot
be severely depressed and anxious at the same time. The construct
of dispositional optimism is closely related to the general self-efficacy
construct, although it is not constrained to the notion of personal
action resources. Thus, a moderate to high positive correlation
has to be expected. The similarity between the obtained patterns
of coefficients in the German and in the Spanish version points
to some degree of cross-language validity of the instrument. Also,
this is in line with previous findings within different German
samples (Schwarzer, 1993).
<P>
Further validity is indicated by the correlation of the scale
with some other items in the Chinese multipurpose questionnaire.
Some questions pertained to the stresses that people in Hong Kong
might experience as they anticipate the transition from British
to Chinese rule in 1997. There were two items that were designed
to assess specific self-efficacy to deal with this stressful political
transition: The first item was &quot;I certainly can meet the
challenges that are implied for me in the upcoming Chinese rule,&quot;
and the second &quot;I am confident that I can deal successfully
with the challenges and threats that occur as the government changes
in Hong Kong.&quot; The first item correlated with general self-efficacy
<U>r</U> = .48, the second <U>r</U> = .44. General self-efficacy
need not necessarily be closely associated with a specific self-efficacy,
but if it does so it may indicate validity. In sum, the three
language versions of the scale can be considered psychometrically
sound and, thus, they constitute adequate versions that can be
used in subsequent research designed for further validation.
<P>
<h2><B>Discussion</B> </h2>
<P>
The present study focussed on a comparison of two new scale adaptations
(Spanish and Chinese) with the well-established German original
version. It was found that in all three languages the psychometric
properties were satisfactory. Reliability, item-total correlations,
and factor loadings indicated that the General Self-Efficacy Scale
can be seen as homogeneous and unidimensional. By achieving these
characteristics it has been demonstrated that the self-efficacy
construct tends to be a universal one, claiming construct validity
across very different cultures. However, this is mainly a psychometric
study, not a truly cross-cultural one. Psychometric equivalence
across languages can be seen as a prerequisite for subsequent
cross-cultural studies that also take indigenous characteristics
of the specific cultures into account.
<P>
The Chinese version is psychometrically the best one, with an
internal consistency of .91 and a normal frequency distribution.
The low mean levels of perceived self-efficacy could be interpreted
as a cultural difference, since the Chinese are regarded as less
individualistic than Westerners (Bond, 1991, 1994; Earley &amp;
Christopher, 1993, 1994). Thus, it would be interesting to compare
their scores in future studies with corresponding levels of collective
self-efficacy (Bandura, 1995b). On the other hand, the present
data base is not representative for Chinese students or even for
the Chinese population. The students in Hong Kong perceive themselves
neither as typically Hong Kongese nor as typically Chinese. Bond
(1994) has found that the self-ratings of these students form
an isolated category that is distinct from the perceived traditional
Chinese, contemporary Chinese, or Westerners. The high educational
level, the Western influence, and the Chinese societal values
may jointly contribute to the establishment of an identity that
is unique for this particular cohort. Thus, any generalization
of test results from the present sample to other segments of the
Chinese population is premature. The lack of generalizability
applies, strictly speaking, also to the Costa Rican samples because
these were large samples of convenience. University students constitute
an elite that has better opportunity structures and more options
for environmental control than the majority of the population.
But in comparing students across countries instead of within countries,
no selection bias is expected. Thus, there is no reason to suspect
that these data are severely biased. In particular, there is no
reason to distrust the German findings since multiple samples
from different cohorts have yielded similar results (see Schwarzer,
1993).
<P>
A more general question is how to establish psychometric equivalence
across languages by using advanced methodology. This can be seen
as a gradual process of continuous replication of psychometric
findings that add to construct validity within and across cultures.
An ambitious quantitative approach to this problem lies in the
specification of a measurement model that refers to more than
one group simultaneously. For example, the model could simply
postulate unidimensionality of the inventory in each sample. In
a much more constrained manner, the model could state that all
factor loadings and measurement errors should be the same across
groups. It is the latter research question that has been applied
in the present study. In order to determine whether such a model
fits the data from several cultures, a multigroup confirmatory
factor analysis was computed. It turned out that the model fit
was not fully satisfactory. The results did not support the assumption
very well that the factor loading pattern is exactly the same
across cultures. Does this finding reject the assumption of cross-language
equivalence? Certainly not, unless one demands a strict item-by-item
equivalence of instruments. The translators had been asked to
understand the theoretical construct of self-efficacy and to find
meaningful adaptations instead of making literal translations
of each item. Under such circumstances, the parameter estimates
for the item pattern might be different from sample to sample,
but the underlying construct of self-efficacy might still be assessed
validly within each sample.
<P>
A related problem arises by inspection of the mean differences
between groups. Why have the Costa Rican students the highest
self-efficacy means and the Chinese students the lowest? It is
assumed that the Chinese have higher collective self-efficacy
than &quot;individualistic&quot; self-efficacy (Bond, 1991, 1994).
However, this difference could be also be an undesired side effect
of the instrument development. Perhaps the Spanish items are &quot;easier&quot;
than the Chinese items. This is a general problem of all cross-cultural
studies using multilanguage versions of the same inventory. The
endorsement of items is multiply determined. Among the factors
that influence the endorsements are characteristics of the cultural
context, those of item wording, and numerous biases, such as situational
circumstances of test administration.
<P>
The same problem pertains to the mean differences between men
and women. In most of the previous German samples under study
there were no gender differences (Schwarzer, 1993), but in the
present sample of German university students, men had higher self-efficacy
than women. The same was found in the Chinese sample. In no study
yet have the women obtained higher self-efficacy than men. This
need not be a disadvantage of the instrument or the construct
itself. Remember that, for example, anxiety, as measured by different
instruments, is usually higher for women than for men. Research
is needed to examine whether the construct of general self-efficacy
favors men, or whether the present inventory contains a &quot;male
bias,&quot; and why in some instances gender differences emerge
and in others not.
<P>
The present analysis was restricted to samples of university students
to assure some homogeneity of the populations under study. Several
other samples, including senior citizens, have also responded
to the questionnaire, but so far only in German. Therefore, they
were not considered here. Further German validation studies can
be found in the scale manual (Schwarzer, 1993).
<P>
In spite of the limitations that are typical for cross-cultural
studies, the psychometric properties of the parsimonious General
Self-Efficacy Scale are now established for three languages. It
is suggested that large-scale field studies may also include these
ten items for enrichment purposes. For example, it could replace
dispositional optimism or self-esteem scales that are often included
in an exploratory manner. Self-esteem is frequently used as a
global indicator of mental health, personal coping resources,
and emotional adjustment without being theoretically elaborated.
Compared to global self-esteem, perceived self-efficacy is a well-established
construct, based on social-cognitive theory that has high explanatory
and operative power (Bandura, 1995a). That is, it not only explains
human functioning quite well, it is also easily alterable by interventions.
The General Self-Efficacy Scale can be used in screening people
at risk for coping deficiencies, which can set the stage for subsequent
prevention programs.
