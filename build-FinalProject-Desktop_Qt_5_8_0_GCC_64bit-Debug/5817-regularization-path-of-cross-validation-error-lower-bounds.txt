Abstract
Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine
learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances.
Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art
than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in
cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error. In
this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV
errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization
path of CV error lower bounds. The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that
how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate that a theoretically guaranteed choice of a regularization
parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs.

Introduction

Many machine learning tasks involve careful tuning of a regularization parameter that controls the
balance between an empirical loss term and a regularization term. A regularization parameter is
usually selected by comparing the cross-validation (CV) errors at several different regularization
parameters. Although its choice has a significant impact on the generalization performances, the
current practice is still more of an art than a science. For example, in commonly used grid-search, it
is hard to tell how many grid points we should search over for obtaining sufficiently small CV error.
In this paper we introduce a novel framework for a class of regularized binary classification problems
that can compute a regularization path of CV error lower bounds. For an ε ∈ [0, 1], we define εapproximate regularization parameters to be a set of regularization parameters such that the CV
error of the solution at the regularization parameter is guaranteed to be no greater by ε than the best
possible CV error in the entire range of regularization parameters. Given a set of solutions obtained,
for example, by grid-search, the proposed framework allows us to provide a theoretical guarantee
of the current best solution by explicitly quantifying its approximation level ε in the above sense.
Furthermore, when a desired approximation level ε is specified, the proposed framework can be used
for efficiently finding one of the ε-approximate regularization parameters.
The proposed framework is built on a novel CV error lower bound represented as a function of the
regularization parameter, and this is why we call it as a regularization path of CV error lower bounds.
Our CV error lower bound can be computed by only using a finite number of solutions obtained by
arbitrary algorithms. It is thus easy to apply our framework to common regularization parameter tuning strategies such as grid-search or Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, the proposed framework
can be used not only with exact optimal solutions but also with sufficiently good approximate solu1

Figure 1: An illustration of the proposed framework. One of our
algorithms presented in §4 automatically selected 39 regularization parameter values in [10−3 , 103 ], and an upper bound of the
validation error for each of them is obtained by solving an optimization problem approximately. Among those 39 values, the
one with the smallest validation error upper bound (indicated as
⋆ at C = 1.368) is guaranteed to be ε(= 0.1) approximate regularization parameter in the sense that the validation error for
the regularization parameter is no greater by ε than the smallest
possible validation error in the whole interval [10−3 , 103 ]. See
§5 for the setup (see also Figure 3 for the results with other options).
tions, which is computationally advantageous because completely solving an optimization problem
is often much more costly than obtaining a reasonably good approximate solution.
Our main contribution in this paper is to show that a theoretically guaranteed choice of a regularization parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs. To the best
of our knowledge, there is no other existing methods for providing such a theoretical guarantee on
CV error that can be used as generally as ours. Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of the algorithm for
obtaining ε = 0.1 approximate regularization parameter (see §5 for the setup).

Related works Optimal regularization parameter can be found if its exact regularization path can
be computed. Exact regularization path has been intensively studied [1, 2], but they are known to be
numerically unstable and do not scale well. Furthermore, exact regularization path can be computed
only for a limited class of problems whose solutions are written as piecewise-linear functions of the
regularization parameter [3]. Our framework is much more efficient and can be applied to wider
classes of problems whose exact regularization path cannot be computed. This work was motivated
by recent studies on approximate regularization path [4, 5, 6, 7]. These approximate regularization
paths have a property that the objective function value at each regularization parameter value is no
greater by ε than the optimal objective function value in the entire range of regularization parameters. Although these algorithms are much more stable and efficient than exact ones, for the task
of tuning a regularization parameter, our interest is not in objective function values but in CV errors. Our approach is more suitable for regularization parameter tuning tasks in the sense that the
approximation quality is guaranteed in terms of CV error.
As illustrated in Figure 1, we only compute a finite number of solutions, but still provide approximation guarantee in the whole interval of the regularization parameter. To ensure such a property, we
need a novel CV error lower bound that is sufficiently tight and represented as a monotonic function
of the regularization parameter. Although several CV error bounds (mostly for leave-one-out CV) of
SVM and other similar learning frameworks exist (e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11]), none of them satisfy the above
required properties. The idea of our CV error bound is inspired from recent studies on safe screening
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16] (see Appendix A for the detail). Furthermore, we emphasize that our contribution is not in presenting a new generalization error bound, but in introducing a practical framework
for providing a theoretical guarantee on the choice of a regularization parameter. Although generalization error bounds such as structural risk minimization [17] might be used for a rough tuning of
a regularization parameter, they are known to be too loose to use as an alternative to CV (see, e.g.,
§11 in [18]). We also note that our contribution is not in presenting new method for regularization
parameter tuning such as Bayesian optimization [19], random search [20] and gradient-based search
[21]. As we demonstrate in experiments, our approach can provide a theoretical approximation
guarantee of the regularization parameter selected by these existing methods.

Problem Setup

We consider linear binary classification problems. Let {(xi , yi ) ∈ Rd ×{−1, 1}}i∈[n] be the training
set where n is the size of the training set, d is the input dimension, and [n] := {1, . . . , n}. An independent held-out validation set with size n′ is denoted similarly as {(x′i , yi′ ) ∈ Rd × {−1, 1}}i∈[n′ ] .
A linear decision function is written as f (x) = w⊤ x, where w ∈ Rd is a vector of coefficients,
and ⊤ represents the transpose. We assume the availability of a held-out validation set only for simplifying the exposition. All the proposed methods presented in this paper can be straightforwardly
2

adapted to a cross-validation setup. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be kernelized if the loss
function satisfies a certain condition. In this paper we focus on the following class of regularized
convex loss minimization problems:

wC

ℓ(yi , w⊤ xi ),
(1)
w∈Rd 2
i∈[n]

where C > 0 is the regularization parameter, and ∥ · ∥ is the Euclidean norm. The loss function is
denoted as ℓ : {−1, 1} × R → R. We assume that ℓ(·, ·) is convex and subdifferentiable in the 2nd
argument. Examples of such loss functions include logistic loss, hinge loss, Huber-hinge loss, etc.
For notational convenience, we denote the individual loss as ℓi (w) := ℓ(yi , w⊤ xi ) for all i ∈ [n].
∗
The optimal solution for the regularization parameter C is explicitly denoted as wC
. We assume that
the regularization parameter is defined in a finite interval [Cℓ , Cu ], e.g., Cℓ = 10−3 and Cu = 103
as we did in the experiments.
For a solution w ∈ Rd , the validation error1 is defined as

by which we can find how accurate our search (grid-search, typically) is in a sense of the deviation
of the achieved validation error from the true minimum in the range, i.e., Ev∗ . The second problem
setup is, given the approximation level ε, to find an ε-approximate regularization parameter within
an interval C ∈ [Cl , Cu ], which is defined as an element of the following set

Our goal in this second setup is to derive an efficient exploration procedure which achieves the
specified validation approximation level ε. These two problem setups are both common scenarios in
practical data analysis, and can be solved by using our proposed framework for computing a path of
validation error lower bounds.

Validation error lower bounds as a function of regularization parameter

In this section, we derive a validation error lower bound which is represented as a function of the
regularization parameter C. Our basic idea is to compute a lower and an upper bound of the inner
∗⊤ ′
product score wC
xi for each validation input x′i , i ∈ [n′ ], as a function of the regularization param∗⊤ ′
eter C. For computing the bounds of wC
xi , we use a solution (either optimal or approximate) for
a different regularization parameter C̃ ̸= C.
3.1

Score bounds

∗⊤ ′
We first describe how to obtain a lower and an upper bound of inner product score wC
xi based on
an approximate solution ŵC̃ at a different regularization parameter C̃ ̸= C.
Lemma 1. Let ŵC̃ be an approximate solution of the problem (1) for a regularization parameter
value C̃ and ξi (ŵC ) be a subgradient of ℓi at w = ŵC such that a subgradient of the objective
function is

For simplicity, we regard a validation instance whose score is exactly zero, i.e., w⊤ x′i = 0, is correctly
classified in (2). Hereafter, we assume that there are no validation instances whose input vector is completely
0, i.e., x′i = 0, because those instances are always correctly classified according to the definition in (2).

The proof is presented in Appendix A. Lemma 1 tells that we have a lower and an upper bound of the

When ŵC̃ is optimal, it can be shown that (see Proposition B.24 in [22]) there exists a subgradient
such that g(ŵC̃ ) = 0, meaning that the bounds are tight because γ(g(ŵC̃ ), x′i ) = δ(g(ŵC̃ ), x′i ) = 0.

The results in Corollary 2 are obtained by simply substituting C = C̃ into (5a) and (5b).
3.2

Validation Error Bounds

Given a lower and an upper bound of the score of each validation instance, a lower bound of the
validation error can be computed by simply using the following facts:
∗⊤ ′
yi′ = +1 and U B(wC
xi |ŵC̃ ) < 0 ⇒ mis-classified,

yi′

(6a)

∗⊤ ′
LB(wC
xi |ŵC̃ )

= −1 and
> 0 ⇒ mis-classified.
(6b)
Furthermore, since the bounds in Lemma 1 linearly change with the regularization parameter C, we
can identify the interval of C within which the validation instance is guaranteed to be mis-classified.
Lemma 3. For a validation instance with yi′ = +1, if
β(ŵC̃ , x′i )
α(ŵC̃ , x′i )
C̃ < C <
C̃
or
C̃ < C < C̃,
α(ŵC̃ , x′i ) + δ(g(ŵC̃ ), x′i )
β(ŵC̃ , x′i ) + γ(g(ŵC̃ ), x′i )
then the validation instance (x′i , yi′ ) is mis-classified. Similarly, for a validation instance with yi′ =
−1, if
α(ŵC̃ , x′i )
β(ŵC̃ , x′i )
C̃ < C <
C̃ or
C̃ < C < C̃,
′
′
β(ŵC̃ , xi ) + γ(g(ŵC̃ ), xi )
α(ŵC̃ , x′i ) + δ(g(ŵC̃ ), x′i )
then the validation instance (x′i , yi′ ) is mis-classified.
This lemma can be easily shown by applying (5) to (6).
As a direct consequence of Lemma 3, the lower bound of the validation error is represented as a
function of the regularization parameter C in the following form.

Remark 5. We note that our validation error lower bound is inspired from recent studies on safe
screening [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], which identifies sparsity of the optimal solutions before solving the
optimization problem. A key technique used in those studies is to bound Lagrange multipliers at the
optimal, and we utilize this technique to prove Lemma 1, which is a core of our framework.

Algorithm

In this section we present two algorithms for each of the two problems discussed in §2. Due to the
space limitation, we roughly describe the most fundamental forms of these algorithms. Details and
several extensions of the algorithms are presented in supplementary appendices B and C.
4.1

Problem setup 1: Computing the approximation level ε from a given set of solutions

Given a set of (either optimal or approximate) solutions ŵC̃1 , . . . , ŵC̃T , obtained e.g., by ordinary
grid-search, our first problem is to provide a theoretical approximation level ε in the sense of (3)2 .
This problem can be solved easily by using the validation error lower bounds developed in §3.2. The
algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1, where we compute the current best validation error Evbest in
∗
line 1, and a lower bound of the best possible validation error Ev∗ := minC∈[Cℓ ,Cu ] Ev (wC
) in line
2. Then, the approximation level ε can be simply obtained by subtracting the latter from the former.
We note that LB(Ev∗ ), the lower bound of Ev∗ , can be easily computed by using T evaluation error
∗
lower bounds LB(Ev (wC
)|wC̃t ), t = 1, . . . , T , because they are staircase functions of C.
4.2

Problem setup 2: Finding an ε-approximate regularization parameter

Given a desired approximation level ε such as ε = 0.01, our second problem is to find an εapproximate regularization parameter. To this end we develop an algorithm that produces a set of
optimal or approximate solutions ŵC˜1 , . . . , ŵC˜T such that, if we apply Algorithm 1 to this sequence,
then approximation level would be smaller than or equal to ε. Algorithm 2 is the pseudo-code of
this algorithm. It computes approximate solutions for an increasing sequence of regularization parameters in the main loop (lines 2-11).
2

When we only have approximate solutions ŵC̃1 , . . . , ŵC̃T , Eq. (3) is slightly incorrect. The first term of
the l.h.s. of (3) should be minC̃t ∈{C̃1 ,...,C̃T } U B(Ev (ŵC̃t )|ŵC̃t ).

C best can still keep ε-approximation property
for C > C̃t . Thus, in line 3, we approximately solve the optimization problem (1) at C = C̃t and obtain an approximate solution
ŵC̃t . Note that the approximate solution ŵC̃t must be sufficiently good enough in the sense that

U B(Ev (wC̃

Our next task is to find C̃t+1 in such a way that C best is an ε-approximate regularization parameter
in the interval [Cl , C̃t+1 ]. Using the validation error lower bound in Theorem 4, the task is to find
the smallest C̃t+1 > C̃t that violates

Experiments

In this section we present experiments for illustrating the proposed methods. Table 2 summarizes
the datasets used in the experiments. They are taken from libsvm dataset repository [23]. All the
input features except D9 and D10 were standardized to [−1, 1]3 . For illustrative results, the instances were randomly divided into a training and a validation sets in roughly equal sizes. For
quantitative results, we used 10-fold CV. We used Huber hinge loss (e.g., [24]) which is convex
and subdifferentiable with respect to the second argument. The proposed methods are free from
the choice of optimization solvers. In the experiments, we used an optimization solver described in
[25], which is also implemented in well-known liblinear software [26]. Our slightly modified code

We use D9 and D10 as they are for exploiting sparsity.

(for adaptation to Huber hinge loss) is provided as a supplementary material, and is also available
on https://github.com/takeuchi-lab/RPCVELB. Whenever possible, we used warmstart approach, i.e., when we trained a new solution, we used the closest solutions trained so far
(either approximate or optimal ones) as the initial starting point of the optimizer. All the computations were conducted by using a single core of an HP workstation Z800 (Xeon(R) CPU X5675
(3.07GHz), 48GB MEM). In all the experiments, we set Cℓ = 10−3 and Cu = 103 .
Results on problem 1 We applied Algorithm 1 in §4 to a set of solutions obtained by 1) gridsearch, 2) Bayesian optimization (BO) with expected improvement acquisition function, and 3)
adaptive search with our framework which sequentially computes a solution whose validation lower
bound is smallest based on the information obtained so far. Figure 2 illustrates the results on three
datasets, where we see how the approximation level ε in the vertical axis changes as the number of
solutions (T in our notation) increases. In grid-search, as we increase the grid points, the approximation level ε tends to be improved. Since BO tends to focus on a small region of the regularization
parameter, it was difficult to tightly bound the approximation level. We see that the adaptive search,
using our framework straightforwardly, seems to offer slight improvement from grid-search.
Results on problem 2 We applied Algorithm 2 to benchmark datasets for demonstrating theoretically guaranteed choice of a regularization parameter is possible with reasonable computational
costs. Besides the algorithm presented in §4, we also tested a variant described in supplementary
Appendix B. Specifically, we have three algorithm options. In the first option (op1), we used op∗

ization parameter. In some datasets, the smallest validation errors are less than 0.1 or 0.05, in which
cases we do not report the results (indicated as “Ev < 0.05” etc.). In trick1, we initially computed
solutions at four different regularization parameter values evenly allocated in [10−3 , 103 ] in the logarithmic scale. In trick2, the next regularization parameter C̃t+1 was set by replacing ε in (10) with
1.5ε (see supplementary Appendix B). For the purpose of illustration, we plot examples of validation error curves in several setups. Figure 3 shows the validation error curves of ionosphere (D3)
dataset for several options and ε.
Table 1 shows the number of optimization problems solved in the algorithm (denoted as T ), and
the total computation time in CV setups. The computational costs mostly depend on T , which gets
smaller as ε increases. Two tricks in supplementary Appendix B was effective in most cases for
reducing T . In addition, we see the advantage of using approximate solutions by comparing the
computation times of op1 and op2 (though this strategy is only for ε ̸= 0). Overall, the results
suggest that the proposed algorithm allows us to find theoretically guaranteed approximate regularization parameters with reasonable costs except for ε = 0 cases. For example, the algorithm found
an ε = 0.01 approximate regularization parameter within a minute in 10-fold CV for a dataset with
more than 50000 instances (see the results on D10 for ε = 0.01 with op2 and op3 in Table 1).

Conclusions and future works

We presented a novel algorithmic framework for computing CV error lower bounds as a function
of the regularization parameter. The proposed framework can be used for a theoretically guaranteed
choice of a regularization parameter. Additional advantage of this framework is that we only need to
compute a set of sufficiently good approximate solutions for obtaining such a theoretical guarantee,
which is computationally advantageous. As demonstrated in the experiments, our algorithm is practical in the sense that the computational cost is reasonable as long as the approximation quality ε is
not too close to 0. An important future work is to extend the approach to multiple hyper-parameters
tuning setups.
