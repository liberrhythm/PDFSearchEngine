Proclivity for Improvisation as a Predictor of
Entrepreneurial Intentions
by Keith M. Hmieleski and Andrew C. Corbett

This study examines the relationship between improvisation and entrepreneurial
intentions. Of specific interest is whether or not a proclivity for improvisation explains
any variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond what is accounted for by other
relevant individual difference measures. Using a sample of 430 college students,
entrepreneurial intentions are found to be significantly associated with measures
of personality, motivation, cognitive style, social models, and improvisation. The
strongest relationship is found between entrepreneurial intentions and improvisation. The results of hierarchical regression show that improvisation accounts for a
significant amount of variance in entrepreneurial intention above and beyond what
is accounted for by the other variables.

Introduction
There is a growing view in the literature that entrepreneurship research
should be centered around the process
through which individuals identify and
exploit opportunities to create future
goods and services (Venkataraman
1997). This process has been primarily
described as a strategically planned
sequence of opportunity identification
followed by evaluation and execution
(Shane and Venkataraman 2000). This
rational model is an appropriate starting
point for investigating entrepreneurial
action, but fails to fully elucidate how

entrepreneurs behave within the highly
uncertain, novel, and turbulent environments in which they often operate
(Baron 1998).
This gap has been filled to some
degree by research that has considered
how entrepreneurs use cognitive biases
and heuristics (Busenitz and Barney
1997). According to this body of work,
when information for rational decisionmaking is unavailable and time pressure
is high, entrepreneurs use familiar
mental shortcuts to make decisions. In
conjunction with the strategic planning
view, these complementary perspectives

suggest that entrepreneurs develop and
enact plans when adequate resources are
available and follow pre-scripted routines when rational planning is not possible. We suggest that both of these views
are correct within certain boundary
conditions—such as when resources are
available for planning or when a heuristic is available for making a quick decision. But through what process do
entrepreneurs act when there is no time
for planning and no available heuristic to
follow?
A recent study by Baker, Miner, and
Eesley (2003) points out that these conditions, in which neither strategic planning nor heuristics and biases are
feasible, are markedly common throughout the entrepreneurial process. The
authors examined the nascent activities
of 68 firms through interviews with
their founders and employees, and the
collection of public documents. Contrary to the utility maximization model
of entrepreneurial action (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000), none of the firms
in the study behaved in a manner that
was primarily strategically planned.
Further, many of the firms lacked the
background to have formed heuristics
to fall back upon during the uncertain
conditions through which they navigated. Instead, the authors described
the behavior of these firms as being
characteristic of improvisation. This is to
say that the norm for these new ventures was to extemporaneously compose and execute novel solutions to the
problems and opportunities that they
encountered.
Baker, Miner, and Eesley (2003)
demonstrate that improvisation is often
an elemental factor in the founding of
new firms and that it is also useful in the
exploitation of opportunity. The authors
note, however, that their study was
exploratory, inductive, and designed to
focus only on generating hypotheses
about improvisation and firm founding.
Baker and his colleagues call for further

46

research to test the role of improvisation
in entrepreneurship. The current study
heeds this call by first developing a conceptual framework for improvisation and
then testing hypotheses regarding the
role of improvisation within the process
of entrepreneurship.

Improvisation and
Entrepreneurship
Improvisation can extend current
entrepreneurship theory by providing a
framework for explaining how entrepreneurs deviate from both strategic plans
and cognitive biases and heuristics in
order to exploit opportunities in the
moment, as they arise. We suggest that
entrepreneurial action occurs in at least
four different ways, depending on the
novelty of the situation and the resource
constraints of the individual or firm (see
Figure 1). For example, when information and time are abundant, strategic
planning is likely to occur. On occasions
when time and information are both
limited, but the entrepreneur has moderate familiarity with the problem or
opportunity, then cognitive heuristics
and biases are likely to be available and
employed. When resources are abundant, but the novelty of the situation is
very high, the entrepreneur can afford
to take a trial-and-error approach—and
likely will need to in order to gather
further information. Finally, when
resource constraints are prohibitive and
the entrepreneur finds himself/herself
faced with a novel problem or opportunity, then improvisation appears to be
the most reasonable course of action. In
this instance, the entrepreneur has only
one opportunity to “get it right.” Constraints on time and resources do not
allow for planning or trial-and-error,
and the extreme novelty makes the
use of heuristics and biases untenable.
Under these conditions, however, existing strategic plans and/or cognitive
biases and heuristics can serve as useful
referents to be deviated from (or impro-

vised on) during an improvisational
episode.
The improvisation process occurs in
the following manner. First, an individual
is presented with a problem (which in
the context of entrepreneurship, might
be viewed as an opportunity). Next, the
individual compares the problem to
others that he/she has previously faced
and selects a referent based on past
experience. A referent is a plan or strategy for reacting to the environment
(Hmieleski and Corbett 2003). It can be
as formal as a published standard operating procedure or as informal as a cognitive bias or heuristic (Busenitz and
Barney 1997). After identifying the referent, the decision-maker considers its
feasibility given the constraints that
characterize the problem (for example,
the available resources). If the referent is
feasible and appears to have a high probability of success, then it should be
followed. Otherwise, the actor should
improvise by either extending or reconfiguring the referent to construct a novel
course of action. This entire process
occurs extemporaneously, such that the
individual is assessing probabilities and

formulating strategy while acting out the
solution. The extemporaneous nature of
the improvisation process suggests that
cognitive heuristics and biases are likely
to be the most commonly employed
referents.
The use of cognitive heuristics and
biases during the improvisation process
raises the often asked question of
whether entrepreneurs tend to prefer
heuristic rather than systematic thinking
(Baron and Ward 2004). Certainly, empirical findings demonstrating a positive
relationship between individuals’ proclivity for improvisation and entrepreneurial intentions would suggest that
entrepreneurs might indeed lean toward
heuristic thinking more so than others.
An analogous discussion is offered by
Levi-Strauss (1966, pp. 16–17) in his comparison of bricoleurs and craftsmen. He
describes bricoleurs as individuals who
use “devious means” (that is, novel
processes) to recombine resources that
are available at hand to accomplish their
work. In contrast, he illustrates how
craftsmen restrict themselves to a subset
of resources or tools that are used to
accomplish their tasks, with little devia-

47

tion. In this vein, entrepreneurs might be
considered bricoleurs—relying heavily
on improvisation, versus corporate managers, for example—who, like craftsmen,
rely more heavily on traditional tools
and/or strategies.
Aside from the Baker, Miner, and
Eesley (2003) article, there appears to be
little published research directly investigating the role of improvisation in entrepreneurship. A similar gap in the
mainstream
management
literature
seems to exist in regard to individual
level work on improvisation. There have,
however, been noteworthy investigations
of improvisation at the group and organizational levels. Eisenhardt and Tabrizi
(1995) conducted a study contrasting
rational versus improvisational processes
of new product development. Their
findings suggest that a real-time, handson approach to product development
tends to be more effective than rational, efficiency-oriented approaches
—especially for uncertain products and
when speed is of the essence. Brown
and Eisenhardt (1997) examined continuous change processes within large
technology-oriented firms and found that
those organizations most successful at
change tend to have a greater capacity
for improvisation. These organizations
provide enough flexibility for their
workers to leverage their improvisation
competencies, but are not so unstructured as to allow their operations to
become unmanageable. Moorman and
Miner (1998) found that environmental
turbulence tends to have a positive influence on the incidence of improvisation,
organizational memory tends to have a
negative influence on the incidence of
improvisation, and that environmental
turbulence, real-time information flow
and organizational memory tend to have
a positive effect on the effectiveness of
improvisation. Additional research conducted by Miner, Bassoff, and Moorman
(2001) indicates that improvisation can
be accepted and incorporated into

48

formal organizational activities, such that
organizations may be able to plan for
improvisation by creating opportunities
for improvisation and supporting the
improvisation process.
In regard to entrepreneurship, two
important points can be drawn from
these studies. First, improvisation seems
to be an effective behavioral strategy for
dealing with change, particularly in
dynamic conditions—such as those in
which new ventures operating in highgrowth industries commonly face.
Second, it appears that improvisational
activities can be incorporated into specific work processes, as well as an organization’s culture. Thus, entrepreneurs
might consider actively managing the
degree to which their firms improvise,
and do so in accordance with the
demands of their environment. As
improvisation appears to be an important behavioral strategy for navigating
the entrepreneurial process, we seek to
determine the extent to which nascent
entrepreneurs tend to have a proclivity
for improvisational behavior.

Entrepreneurial Intentions
As a first step toward investigating the
improvisational tendencies of entrepreneurs, we set out to examine how
improvisation relates to entrepreneurial
intentions (Bird 1988). Specifically, we
seek to determine whether or not individuals exhibiting a proclivity for
improvisation display a tendency toward
self-selecting themselves into the field of
entrepreneurship. To this end, a measure
of improvisation is developed and contrasted with other relevant individual
difference measures in regard to the
dependent measure of intent to start a
new business.
Entrepreneurial intentions, for the
purposes of the current study, are
defined as intentions toward starting a
high-growth business. We adopt a highgrowth perspective for three reasons.
The primary rationale being that high-

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

growth start-ups operate in turbulent
environments (Venkataraman et al.
1990). This type of environment is
characterized by factors such as time
pressure and novelty, which demand frequent improvisation as a requirement for
survival. A secondary reason is that highgrowth ventures are a primary creator of
new jobs (Reynolds et al. 2002). Thus,
new knowledge relating to the process
of creating high-growth ventures is likely
to have important societal implications.
Finally, small businesses, which are
content to maintain the status quo, are
fundamentally different from highgrowth ventures in terms of innovation,
strategic orientation, and propensity for
bearing risk (Carland et al. 1984).
Accordingly, the characteristics of the
founders for each type of business (lowgrowth and high-growth) are likely to be
substantially different (Stewart et al.
1998). In the following sections, we
outline hypotheses that consider the
association of entrepreneurial intentions
with measures of improvisation, personality, motivation, cognitive style, and
social models.
Considering the centrality of improvisation
within
the
entrepreneurial
process, we expect to find a positive relationship between one’s propensity for
improvising and extent of entrepreneurial intentions. Thus, we suspect that
improvisational individuals tend to seek
out entrepreneurial opportunities, in
part, as a pathway to act upon their
natural inclination to improvise.
H1: The greater the proclivity for improvisation, the greater will be the intent
to start a high-growth business.

Personality
Recently, there has been a resurgence
of individual differences research in
organizational behavior, which has, in
part, been spawned by investigations of
the five fundamental dimensions of personality known as “The Big Five” (for

example, Hogan and Holland 2003;
Hurtz and Donovan 2000; Judge and
Bono 2000). Advocates of this perspective claim that most individual differences can be traced back to variations in
standing across these five dimensions—
extraversion, contentiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness.
With few exceptions (Ciavarella et al.
2004; Singh, De Noble, and Kalousova
2002; Wooten, Timmerman, and Folger
1999), entrepreneurship researchers
have ignored The Big Five, instead
opting for the use of less theoretically
and psychometrically sound measures,
such as locus of control (Chen, Greene,
and Crick 1998) and risk-taking propensity (Brockhaus 1980). This fact might
partially explain why much of the entrepreneurship literature on individual differences is either contradictory and/or
inconclusive. Therefore, in order to
further the field of entrepreneurship and
validate our research in the eyes of those
working in complementary fields, it is
important that we demonstrate that our
constructs
and
measures
provide
explanatory value beyond those that
have longer and validated histories of
use in other domains. In this vein, we
anticipate that improvisation will provide
explanatory value in regard to entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is
accounted for by The Big Five.
H2: Proclivity for improvisation will
account for a significant amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is accounted
for by personality.

Motivation
A firm cannot easily exist without
employees to carry out the day-to-day
operations that define its purpose. Thus,
an essential aspect of any organization is
the active and persistent effort of its
workers (Baron 1991). Research on
worker motivation has primarily focused
on factors that initiate and sustain the

HMIELESKI AND CORBETT

49

behavior of individuals and groups
within organizations (Ambrose and Kulik
1999). Measures of self-efficacy (Chen,
Greene, and Crick 1998), locus of control
(Gilad 1982), need for autonomy (Cromie
1987), risk-taking (Brockhaus 1980) tolerance for ambiguity (Begley and Boyd
1987) have pervaded the literature in
regard to entrepreneurial motivation
(Shane, Locke, and Collins 2003; Vecchio
2003). Similar to our previous hypotheses, it is also necessary that new constructs within our own field show
explanatory value beyond those that are
more commonly used in entrepreneurship research. To this end, we seek to
determine whether or not improvisation
provides explanatory value in regard to
entrepreneurial intentions beyond that
which is accounted for by commonly
investigated correlates of entrepreneurial
motivation.
H3: Proclivity for improvisation will
account for a significant amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is accounted
for by motivation.

Cognitive Style
A recent trend in the entrepreneurship
literature is to consider the variety of
ways in which entrepreneurs process
information (Baron 2004). The different
ways that individuals react to stimuli in
various environments comprise the field
of cognitive styles research. Within the
cognitive styles literature, research pertaining to innovation, intuition, and
learning are likely to be of particular relevance to entrepreneurship (Allison and
Hayes 1996; Eison and Pollio 1990;
Kirton and Pender 1982). For example,
Corbett (2005) suggests that the manner
in which individuals cognitively process
information is related to their ability to
identify and exploit opportunities. A
follow-up empirical study supports this
assertion by showing a relationship
between cognition and the discovery of

50

entrepreneurial opportunities (Corbett,
forthcoming). Here, we seek to determine whether or not improvisation adds
any explanatory value in regard to entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which
is accounted for by these aspects of cognitive style.
H4: Proclivity for improvisation will
account for a significant amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is accounted
for by cognitive style.

Social Models
Social models have been shown to be
a consistent and strong predictor of
entrepreneurial
intentions
(Hisrich
1990). This is to say that individuals who
have family members and/or close
friends who are entrepreneurs tend to,
on average, be more likely to start their
own business than those who have not
benefited from the same level of exposure to entrepreneurship. This appears to
be, in part, due to the lower barriers to
entry into entrepreneurship that these
individuals tend to experience through
the opportunity that they possess to capitalize on their close ties with entrepreneurs (Greve and Salaff 2003). Thus, we
seek to determine whether or not
improvisation adds any explanatory
value in regard to entrepreneurial intention beyond that which is accounted for
by entrepreneurial social models.
H5: Proclivity for improvisation will
account for a significant amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is accounted
for by the individual’s entrepreneurial social models.

Cumulative Test
As an overall test, we are curious to
determine whether or not improvisation
explains any variance in entrepreneurial
intentions when personality, motivation,

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

cognitive style, and social models are
simultaneously controlled for.
H6: Proclivity for improvisation will
account for a significant amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions beyond that which is accounted
for by personality, motivation, cognitive style, and entrepreneurial social
models.

Method
Participants
Five hundred and ninety undergraduate students participated in the study.
One hundred and sixty of these participants were subsequently eliminated
because their scores on the dependent
measure, entrepreneurial intentions,
varied by more than 25 percent between
Part 1 and Part 2 of the study. Thus, the
eliminated participants either did not
attentively complete each portion of
the study or did not have a clear view
regarding the extent of their intentions
to start a new business. The resulting
sample consisted of 430 participants
(322 males and 108 females). The mean
age was 20 (S.D. = 1.50) years old. The
ethnic composition of the sample
included Caucasians (n = 322), Asians
(n = 58), Hispanics (n = 19), African
Americans (n = 15), and Native Americans (n = 2). Fourteen of the participants
failed to report their ethnicity. Twentyeight of the participants had started
their own business, 74 had worked for a
start-up, and 37 had taken a course in
entrepreneurship.

Measures
Improvisation. A 27-item instrument
was developed as a part of the current
study in order to measure one’s proclivity for improvising. The instrument contains three scales, each comprised of
nine items. The first dimension relates to
creativity and bricolage (alpha = 0.89),
and was partly adapted from Tierney,
Farmer, and Graen (1999) following the

work of Vera (2002). This dimension represents the extent to which individuals
are able to produce novel solutions
under constrained conditions by recombining available resources. Individuals
high in this dimension are likely to seek
out opportunities to display their ingenuity. The second dimension relates to
the ability to function and excel under
pressure-filled and stressful environments (alpha = 0.83). This dimension
represents the ability of individuals to
excel in uncertain and rapidly changing
environments. Individuals who are high
in this dimension tend to rise to the occasion and perform best under pressure.
The final dimension relates to spontaneity and persistence (alpha = 0.70), and
was partly adapted from Unger and
Kernan (1983) and Moorman and Miner
(1998) following the work of Vera (2002).
This dimension represents the actionorientation and determination of individuals toward achieving goals and solving
problems in the moment. Individuals
who are high in this dimension tend to
prefer action rather than analysis and are
highly focused on the problem at hand.
These individuals are opportunistic and
act with a killer instinct. The threedimensional structure of the measure
was confirmed using principal components factor analysis. These dimensions
are aggregated to form a total score representing an individual’s overall proclivity for improvisation (alpha = 0.87). Thus,
a high score represents a preference
toward improvisational action. A threeweek test–retest of the measure produced a correlation coefficient of .85 for
the total scale. The three-factor confirmatory principal components matrix
along with each item can be viewed in
Table 1.
Personality. The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) (Goldberg 1999) was
used to measure the five facets of personality. The IPIP measures the same
domain constructs as the NEO-PI-R

(Costa and McCrae 1992), which is
perhaps the most widely used and psychometrically sound commercially published personality inventory. The primary
advantage of the IPIP is that it contains
two-thirds less items, while maintaining
acceptable psychometric properties. The
five scales of the IPIP include a sevenitem measure of agreeableness—extent
of friendliness and cooperation (alpha =
0.74), 10-item measure of conscientiousness—extent of organization and persistence (alpha = 0.82), nine-item measure of
extraversion—extent of outgoingness in
social settings (alpha = 0.87), seven-item
measure of openness—extent of desire to
partake in a variety of experiences (alpha
= 0.85), and eight-item measure of emotional stability—extent of insecurity and
emotional distress (alpha = 0.85).
Motivation. In this section we grouped
five of the most commonly studied
constructs relating to entrepreneurial
motives. These constructs include selfefficacy, locus of control, need for autonomy, risk-taking, and tolerance for
ambiguity.
Self-efficacy was measured using the
General Self-Efficacy Scale (Schwarzer
1993). The instrument is comprised of 10
items, which are added together to form
an overall measure of general selfefficacy (alpha = 0.82). High scores represent the belief in an individual’s ability
to produce high levels of performance in
tasks undertaken in life. Specific measures of entrepreneurial self-efficacy, such
as those developed by Chen, Greene, and
Crick (1998) and De Noble, Jung, and
Ehrlich (1999), comprised of items specific to managerial and entrepreneurial
skills were considered. However, these
instruments were considered inappropriate for use with our sample of undergraduates from technology related fields,
because they were unlikely to have much
exposures to the business related concepts in which the items within these
measures are comprised.

Levinson’s (1980) chance scale was
used as a measure of locus of control.
The scale is comprised of eight items that
are added together to form a measure of
the degree to which a person believes
that chance influences his/her outcomes
in life (alpha = 0.72). Positive scores represent an internal locus of control,
whereas negative scores represent an
external locus of control.
Deci and Ryan’s (2000) Need for
Autonomy Scale was used to measure the
basic desire for an individual to exercise
his/her free will. The scale is comprised
of seven items that are aggregated to
form a general measure of need for
autonomy (alpha = 0.68). High scoring
individuals have a preference for setting
their own goals and agendas, and for
seeking autonomous environments.
The Risk Attitudes Inventory (Calvert
1993) was used to measure the risktaking propensity of individuals. The
scale is comprised of 15 items that are
added to form an overall score of one’s
risk-taking attitude (alpha = 0.57). High
scores represent the extent to which
people are willing to partake in events
that have uncertain outcomes and for
which the consequences of failure are
meaningful.
The Tolerance for Ambiguity Scale
(Budner 1962) was used to measure the
extent to which individuals are threatened by situations that are ambiguous,
rapidly changing, and unpredictable. The
scale is comprised of 16 items that are
summed to form an overall score of one’s
tolerance for ambiguity (alpha = 0.62).
Individuals who score high on this
measure tend to be comfortable working
in complex environments and with
limited information.
Cognitive Style. The Cognitive Style
Index Allison and Hayes, 1996) was used
as a measure of how individuals think.
The scale is comprised of 38 items that
are summed to form an overall score of
one’s cognitive style (alpha = 0.85). High

HMIELESKI AND CORBETT

53

scores represent a left-brain or analyticalorientation, whereas low scores represent a right-brain or intuitive-orientation.
The Kirton Adaptor Innovator Inventory (Kirton and Pender, 1982) was used
to measure individual styles of defining
and solving problems. The scale is comprised of 32 items that are added to form
an overall score of one’s problem-solving
style (alpha = 0.85). High scoring individuals have an innovative style, and
tend to be independent thinkers and
game changers. In contrast, low scoring
individuals tend to have an adaptive
style, such that they prefer working
within the status quo.
The Learning-Orientation/Grade-Orientation (LOGO) II Scale was used to
assess the learning- and grade-oriented
attitudes and behaviors of the participants (Eison and Pollio 1990). The LOGO
II is comprised of two main 16-item
scales, one representing grade-oriented
attitudes and behaviors (GOT; alpha =
0.76) and the other representing
learning-oriented attitudes and behaviors
(LOT; alpha = 0.76). Individuals scoring
high on the LOT scale seek opportunities for learning outside of the classroom
in order to fulfill their natural curiosity.
Those who score high on the GOT scale
structure their studies around the
achievement of grades and material
rewards.
Social Models. We developed a fiveitem measure to assess the extent to
which participants have social models
who are entrepreneurs. The items ask
whether or not the individual has an
immediate family member who has
started a business, has an immediate
family member who is a successful entrepreneur, has a close friend who has
started a business, has a close friend who
is a successful entrepreneur, and knows
many people who have started their own
business (alpha = 0.86). High scores indicate that the individual has an extensive
array of entrepreneurial social models.

54

Entrepreneurial Intentions. For this
scale we used five items from Chen,
Greene, and Crick (1998) to assess
whether or not participants intend to
start a new business. These items asked
whether or not the individual is interested in starting a business, has considered a particular type of business to start,
has begun planning for starting a business, is likely to try hard to start a business, and plans to start a business in the
near future. In addition, we included five
items that were created for the current
study regarding the extent to which participants want to rapidly grow a new
business. These items asked whether or
not the individual would like to start a
business that will grow rapidly, become
an industry leader, have multiple locations, be listed on a major stock market,
and become known internationally.
Thus, the aggregate measure indicates
the degree of intent to start a new
high-growth business (alpha = 0.94). A
three-week test–retest of the measure
produced a correlation coefficient of 0.93
for the total scale.

Procedure
The measures were compiled to form
two separate surveys in order to minimize fatigue on the participants and to
allow for a test–retest of the improvisation, social models, and entrepreneurial
intensions measures. The first survey
(Part I) was comprised of items pertaining to improvisation, personality, selfefficacy, need for autonomy, locus of
control, entrepreneurial intentions, social
models, and demographics. The second
survey (Part II) contained the same items
pertaining to improvisation, entrepreneurial intentions, and social models as
well as items pertaining to cognitive
style, tolerance for ambiguity, risk taking,

(model 3), improvisation accounted for
an additional 9.5 percent ( p < .01) of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions
beyond the 13.3 percent ( p < .01) that
was explained for by the measures of
cognitive style (in support of H4).
Social Models. As shown in Table 3
(model 4), improvisation accounted for
an additional 14.1 percent ( p < .01) of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions
beyond the 12.5 percent ( p < .01) that
was explained for by social models (in

Cumulative Test. As shown in Table 3
(model 5), improvisation accounted for

variance in entrepreneurial intentions
beyond the 24.5 percent ( p < .01) that
was explained for by the combination of
personality, motivation, cognitive style,
and social models (in support of H6).
Entrepreneurial Experience. As a supplementary analysis, we took a closer
look at those participants who had some
entrepreneurial experience. Proclivity for
improvisation accounted for the following percentages of variance in entrepreneurial intentions: 10.2 percent (n = 28,
p > .05) for those who had started a business, 28.1 percent (n = 74, p < .01) for
those who had worked for a start-up,
17.6 percent (n = 37, p < .01) for those
who had taken a course in entrepreneurship, and 18.5 percent (n = 133,
p < .01) overall for participants who had
at least one of these three types of
experience.

Follow-Up Study
Whereas some have criticized the use
of students as subjects in behavioral research (Copeland, Francia, and

Strawser 1973), there have also been
studies that have shown that graduate
students are good proxies for decisionmakers in business situations (Khera and
Benson 1970). As such, we sampled 63
(43 males and 20 females) MBA students
in order to cross-validate our results.
Their average age was 29 (S.D. = 4.86)
years old. These participants were only
asked to complete items related to their
proclivity for improvisation, entrepreneurial intentions, and demographics.
Fifteen had started their own business,
18 had worked for a start-up, and 34 had
taken a course in entrepreneurship.
The results of the follow-up survey are
consistent with our initial study. Proclivity for improvisation accounted for 15.2
percent ( p < .01) of the variance in entrepreneurial intentions for this sample.
Drilling down by entrepreneurial experience, proclivity for improvisation
accounted for the following percentages
of variance in entrepreneurial intentions:
47.6 percent (n = 15, p < .01) for those
who had started a business, 17.6 percent
(n = 18, p < .01) for those who had
worked for a start-up, 10.9 percent (n =
34, p < .05) for those who had taken a
course in entrepreneurship, and 12.3
percent (n = 39, p < .05) overall for participants who had at least one of
these three types of experience (see
Table 4).
As shown in Table 4, the follow-up
study with MBA students generally supports the findings from the initial study
using an undergraduate sample. There
are, however, some notable differences
between the amount of variance
explained in entrepreneurial intentions
by proclivity for improvisation between
the undergraduate and MBA student
samples across entrepreneurial experience. Perhaps most interesting is the difference among those who have started
a business. For these individuals, the
relationship between improvisation and
entrepreneurial intentions was much
greater for MBA students than for

undergraduates. This may be an artifact
of the experience of the MBA students,
who are more likely to have started
viable new ventures than less experienced undergraduates who are more
likely to have started businesses as
hobbies, experiencing fewer of the pressures that would require improvisational
action. Conversely, a greater amount of
variance in entrepreneurial intentions
was accounted for by proclivity for
improvisation by undergraduates as compared to MBA students among those who
have worked for a start-up and those
who have taken an entrepreneurship
course. This suggests that entrepreneurship experts and practitioner might have
a greater effect on the entrepreneurial
intentions of undergraduate than their
more “real world” experienced MBA
student counterparts.

Discussion
As indicated by our results, it seems
that improvisation is an important construct to consider in regard to entrepreneurial intentions in that it appears to
add explanatory value above and beyond
other significant predictors, such as

58

measures of personality, motivation,
cognitive style, and social models that
have been previously established in the
literature. More specifically, our results
suggest that nascent entrepreneurs, on
average, exhibit a proclivity for improvisation. Important implications related to
this point are briefly discussed below in
terms of future research, education, and
practice.
Two forms of action have dominated
the
literature
on
entrepreneurial
behavior—strategic planning (Shane and
Venkataraman 2000) and cognitive
heuristics and biases (Busenitz and
Barney 1997). In the current article, we
have suggested that improvisation is a
third and equally important component
in the entrepreneurial process. Earlier,
we illustrated in a 2 ¥ 2 matrix the different types of entrepreneurial action
that are likely to be appropriate when
considering the novelty of the situation
and level of resource constraints (see
Figure 1). In light of our results, we
wonder whether nascent entrepreneurs
improvise in situations in which they
should actually enact strategic plans or
cognitive heuristics and biases (for

JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT

example, when novelty and resource
constraints are low). Our suspicion of
excessive improvisation is consistent
with research indicating that entrepreneurs suffer from a tendency to be overconfident (Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg
1988), and could prove to be an elemental reason for the failure of some
start-ups. Future research could make
important contributions to our understanding of entrepreneurial behavior by
investigating whether entrepreneurs do,
in fact, overimprovise.
The concept of intention implies
planned behavior (Ajzen 1991). In other
words, by saying that an individual
intends to start a business, we are assuming that the individual intends to plan for
the eventuality of starting a business. In
fact, a portion of our measure of entrepreneurial intentions was the extent to
which the individual had begun planning
for the creation of a start-up. Conversely,
the concept of improvisation implies
deviation from a plan or, at an extreme,
operating without a plan. Therefore,
individuals who have a proclivity for
improvisation might not “intend” to start
a business, but may spontaneously
undertake in the creation of a new
venture if an opportunity to do so presents itself. Therefore, proclivity for
improvisation might predict a greater
proportion of variance in the actual decision to start a business than in entrepreneurial intentions. Future research can
answer this question through longitudinally investigating the proclivity for
improvising as a predictor of new
venture creation.
Since nascent entrepreneurs appear to
exhibit a proclivity for improvisation and
improvisation seems to play an important role in the entrepreneurial process
(Baker, Miner, and Eesley 2003), it might
prove worthwhile to consider how
improvisation can be infused into entrepreneurship curriculums. For example,
simulations and role-playing exercises
might be used to help strengthen

students’ improvisational capabilities.
Further, capstone courses might focus on
how to deviate from strategic plans in
order to take advantage opportunities
and solve problems as they arise.
In regard to practice, entrepreneurs
should develop a balance in the makeup
of their founding teams with respect to
improvisational competencies and inclinations. Teams should be neither too
rigid so as to miss opportunities nor too
improvisational to the point where their
firms struggle to establish stability.
Further, it is important for entrepreneurs
to understand that they are less likely to
be successful at improvising in domains
in which they have little expertise
(Crossan 1998). This is an important
point for entrepreneurs to consider when
assessing the level of risk associated with
unique opportunities.

Limitations
In regard to the generalizability of our
results, there are some limitations that
are worthy of discussion. First is the use
of a student sample. One could argue
that our findings might have differed if
we had considered an older and more
experienced sample. We agree with this
presumption, but also advocate the
importance of studying the intentions
of students who, through university
incubator programs and the increased
infusion of entrepreneurship across
educational curriculums, experience
increasingly lower barriers to starting
their own businesses. Additionally, previous entrepreneurship research (Crant
1996; Gartner 1989) has stated that using
a student population may be more
appropriate than using other samples
when researching individual differences
and vocational intentions. It is worthy to
note that most of the participants in our
sample were studying in technical fields
(for example, biotechnology and nanotechnology), and clearly have the
potential to start high-growth firms in
emerging areas of industry. In fact, 28 of

HMIELESKI AND CORBETT

59

the participants had already started their
own firms and 74 had experience
working
for
start-ups. Therefore,
although perhaps narrow, our sampling
frame represents an important population from which future entrepreneurs
will spawn. In support of the generalizability of our results, we found a similar
relationship between proclivity for
improvisation and entrepreneurial intentions in a survey of older and more experienced MBA students. An additional
limitation is the cross-section design of
our study. Although, there is much evidence concerning intentions as a robust
predictor of future behavior (Ajzen
1991), a preferable design would adopt
a longitudinal approach that follows up
to see which participants actually start
their own business.

Conclusions
The study of individual differences in
entrepreneurship has met with inconclusive results, in part, because of the failure
to link characteristics of individuals to
the actual behavioral tendencies of entrepreneurs (Shaver and Scott 1991). This
study attempted to bridge this gap by
considering improvisation, a mode of
action frequently engaged in by entrepreneurs (Baker, Miner, and Eesley
2003), as an individual difference characteristic. Our findings indicate that
proclivity for improvisation can provide
additional information regarding why
individuals intend to become entrepreneurs beyond that which can be found
in measures of personality, motivation,
cognitive style, and social models. The
next step in this line of research is to
investigate how proclivity for improvisation relates to actual firm founding and
subsequent success at various stages of
the entrepreneurial process.
