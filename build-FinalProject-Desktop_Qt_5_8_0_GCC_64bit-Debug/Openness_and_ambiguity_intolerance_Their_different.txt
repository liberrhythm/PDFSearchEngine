Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance

Abstract
Despite previous suggestions that ambiguity intolerance is part of openness, the current study
demonstrates important differences between these traits in the context of an academic life
transition. Openness was expected to be related to well-being through challenge and threat
appraisals in the beginning of the university studies due to its relevance to novelty and intellect.
It was expected to be related to well-being later in the university studies due to its relevance to
intellect. In contrast, ambiguity intolerance was expected to be related to well-being through
challenge and threat appraisals only in the beginning of the university studies. Multigroup path
analyses supported the hypotheses, comparing students in the beginning of the first year of
university with advanced students. In the beginning of the university studies, the relations of
openness and ambiguity intolerance to well-being were mediated by challenge and threat
appraisals. The relationship of openness to well-being remained the same for advanced students,
whereas the relationship of ambiguity intolerance to well-being, challenge and threat appraisals
was reduced to non-significance. The findings contribute to our understanding of contextspecific functions of traits, and more broadly to knowledge on person-environment fit and to
understanding person-situation interactions.

Introduction

The trait ambiguity intolerance (also termed ambiguity tolerance or uncertainty
tolerance/intolerance) is defined as “The tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as sources of
threat.” (Budner, 1962, p.39; see also Furnham, 1994; Furnham & Ribchester, 1995). The trait
openness may be defined as a broad, deep, original, and complex mental and experiential life
(John & Srivastava, 1999). McCrae (1996) suggested that ambiguity intolerance represents a
motivational aspect of openness. Indeed, the two traits have clear similarities to one another. In
particular, both contrast preference for the familiar with openness to novelty. However, unlike
ambiguity intolerance, openness is also related to intellectual interest (see McCrae & Costa,
1997; Ostendorf & Angleitner, 1994). Therefore, they may have similar implications in
situations that encompass novelty and change, but different implications in situations that focus
on academic activities.
Drawing on person-environment fit theories, Emmons, Diener, and Larsen (1986)
suggested that people would experience temporary positive affect in situations that are congruent
with their traits. They indeed found that some traits were related to better mood in situations that
were congruent with these traits. This pattern of findings may be extended to more stable life
situations and their relation to well-being. Therefore, we suggest that openness and ambiguity
intolerance would be related to well-being in life situations that are congruent with these traits.
Yet before addressing the expected relations between these traits and well-being in
certain contexts, it is important to take into consideration the base-line relations of these traits to
well-being. Recent meta analyses have found that openness to experience is typically not related

3

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
to life satisfaction (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Heller, Watson, & Ilies, 2004; Steel, Schmidt, &
Shultz, 2008). Furthermore, openness was not related to reactions to stressful situations (e.g.,
Suls, Martin, & David, 1998), and it showed complex relations to changes in well-being in the
adjustment to a life transition (see Bardi & Ryff, 2007). Similarly to openness, ambiguity
intolerance was found to be unrelated to well-being (as measured by depression) during mundane
everyday life (Andersen & Schwartz, 1992). Yet in the context of adjustment to new life
situations, ambiguity intolerance had maladaptive effects in the adjustment of teachers who were
transferred to a new school (Friedel, & Dalbert, 2003). Because openness and ambiguity
intolerance are not inherently related to well-being they are particularly interesting traits for
examining context-specific relations to well-being.
What situations are likely to be congruent with openness and thus conducive to high
subjective well-being? McCrae (1996) has argued that individuals high on openness are
characterized by a need for variety, and may be motivated to actively seek out the unfamiliar. He
indeed found evidence suggesting that individuals high on openness are more likely to welcome
challenge and change (McCrae & Costa, 1985). This is in contrast to individuals low on
openness, who are more conservative and prefer the familiar over the novel. Therefore, the
beginning of a life transition with the novelty and unfamiliarity that it entails may be enjoyable
for individuals high on openness in comparison with individuals low on openness. As a result,
during the beginning of a life transition, individuals high on openness may experience high
subjective well-being compared with those who are low on openness. Later on in the life
transition openness might not be relevant to well-being anymore, unless other aspects of
openness are relevant to the new life situation. In the context of the transition to university
studies openness may continue to be relevant to well-being because of its relevance to intellect.

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
Specifically, individuals high on openness are interested in intellectual activities and as
university studies provide such activities, this is likely to be an environment congruent with the
trait of openness. Therefore, we expect that openness would be important for well-being also for
more advanced students.
How is ambiguity tolerance likely to relate to well-being in the context of an academic
life transition? The beginning of a life transition is a novel and thus ambiguous situation, as it is
not clear yet how one ought to behave. Therefore, it should be a particularly difficult situation for
individuals high on ambiguity intolerance, and it is likely to result with poor well-being. Indeed,
several studies have found that ambiguity intolerance was associated with difficulties in coping
with change (e.g., Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, & Wellbourne, 1999; Rush, Schoel, & Barnard,
1995). However, when the novelty wears off ambiguity intolerance might not be important for
well-being anymore. Therefore we expect that ambiguity intolerance would be related to wellbeing in the beginning of university studies but not later on.
What might be the process that links openness and ambiguity intolerance to subjective
well-being in the beginning of a life transition? Research shows that interpretations can mediate
the ways in which stressful life events are experienced (e.g., Bauer & Bonanno, 2001; Davis,
Lehman, Wortman, Silver, & Thompson, 1995; Peterson & Seligman, 1987). Indeed, appraisals
mediated the relation between neuroticism and perceived stress (Hemenover & Dienstbier,
1996). Because openness and ambiguity intolerance are likely to be related to subjective wellbeing only in particular life situations, we propose that these relations may be due to appraisals
of this situation. Suitable appraisals can be found in the literature on coping with stressful
situations.

5

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
The beginning of a life transition is a stressful situation even when it is a largely positive
transition (Cantor, Norem, Niendenthal, Langston, & Brower, 1987). Lazarus and Folkman
(1984) suggested that when people are in a stressful situation they tend to appraise the situation
as a threat or a challenge. Appraising a situation as exerting potential threat reflects a lack of
confidence in one’s ability to cope with this situation, and a concern that this situation might
cause harm to the individual. In contrast, appraising a situation as challenging reflects confidence
in one’s ability to cope with the situation as well as anticipation for the future rewards that
successful coping may bring. As a result, threat appraisals co-occur with negative psychological
outcomes, and in particular with experiencing anxiety, whereas challenge appraisals co-occur
with positive psychological outcomes, and in particular with positive affect (Folkman & Lazarus,
1985; Skinner & Brewer, 2002). Therefore, we expect that openness and ambiguity intolerance
would be related to subjective well-being in the beginning of a life transition through threat and
challenge appraisals of the new life situation. Indeed, as openness is typically unrelated to life
satisfaction we may find that it is related to life satisfaction in this context only through
appraisals.
Later on in the university studies challenge and threat appraisals are not likely to be
related to the trait ambiguity intolerance because by then they are likely to loose their relevance
to this trait. However, because openness is still likely to be relevant to well-being later in the
university studies due to its component of intellect it may continue to be related to well-being
through challenge and threat appraisals.
The current study took place at the beginning of the academic year. First year students
were compared with more advanced students. We measured the traits openness and ambiguity
intolerance, challenge and threat appraisals of this life situation, and well-being. Based on the

6

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
relationships proposed on the literature, a model was developed (see Figure 1). We expected
ambiguity intolerance to be related to subjective well-being through perceptions of challenge or
threat only in the beginning of the life transition. In contrast, we expected openness to be related
to subjective well-being through perceptions of challenge and threat at the beginning of the life
transition as well as later on.

Method
Participants and procedure. 510 students participated in the study for extra course credit
or for a chance of winning approximately £50 in a lottery. They completed the questionnaires
online at the beginning of the academic year. Of these, 298 were first year students (235 females;
mean age was 19, SD = 4) and 212 were advanced students (152 females; mean age was 21, SD
= 4).
Measures
Unless stated otherwise, all of the measures were rated on a scale ranging from 1 (disagree
strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). In addition, all scores were computed by averaging the ratings of
the items that comprise the relevant index.
Ambiguity intolerance. We used the 8-item Uncertainty Tolerance Scale (UTS; Dalbert,
1999; an example item is “I like to know what to expect“) due to its good statistical properties.
Indeed, the scale had good internal reliability in the current study (Cronbach α = .71).
Openness. We used the 10 items measuring openness (e.g., “curious about many different
things”) from the Big Five Inventory (John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991). This measure has good
reliability and validity (see John & Srivastava, 1999; in this sample α = .81).

7

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
Threat and challenge appraisals. We comprised a questionnaire to measure stress
appraisal based on the Cognitive Appraisal Scale (Skinner & Brewer, 1999) with some
modifications. Many of the items measuring threat in the original scale of Skinner and Brewer
(1999) tapped directly on anxiety. Yet, we aimed to use anxiety as an outcome indicator.
Therefore, it was important to clearly differentiate these concepts. We therefore developed new
items that measure threat but not anxiety (e.g., “I feel that difficulties could pile up so much that
I might not be able to overcome them”). In addition, some of the challenge items were adapted to
the context of university studies (e.g., “This challenging situation as a student in the university
motivates me to increase my efforts”). Some items were added in order to increase reliability
(e.g., “I view the university studies as a challenge.”). The questionnaire included 18 items, 9
items measuring challenge appraisal and 9 items measuring threat appraisal. The internal
reliabilities of the challenge and threat indexes were 0.77 and 0.83, respectively.
Well-being indicators. The term ‘subjective well-being’ typically includes three
components: positive affect, negative affect, and satisfaction with life (see, e.g., DeNeve &
Cooper, 1998). Therefore, we measured these three components. In addition, we measured
anxiety as we anticipated that it would be particularly relevant in the beginning of a life
transition, due to the stress that is likely to occur in a new life situation (e.g., Holmes & Rahe,
1967). All of the well-being indicators have been used vastly in research. These included: (1)
The satisfaction with life scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen & Griffin, 1985). This instrument
includes five items (e.g., “I am satisfied with my life”, in this study α = .82). (2) Anxiety
measured with Spielberger (1983)’s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Participants rated how they
felt during the past week on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) (e.g., “During the
past week, I felt worried about possible misfortune.”). The internal reliability (5 items) was 0.83

8

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
in this study. (3) Positive and negative affect were measured with the 20-item PANAS (Watson,
Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), asking about participants’ feelings in the past week on a scale ranging
from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The PANAS had good internal reliabilities (α = .86 for
negative affect, and α = .87 for positive affect).
Results
Statistical information on the variables in both samples is presented in Table 1.
Significant differences were found between first- and advanced year students only on openness, t
(508) = 2.45, p < .05 and anxiety, t (508) = 2.25, p < .05, with advanced-year students scoring
higher on both variables.
The patterns of correlations among the variables are presented in Table 2. The correlation
between openness and ambiguity intolerance was much stronger in first year students compared
with more advanced students (r = -.42 and -.25, respectively), suggesting that these traits may be
more functionally similar in the beginning of a life transition. In a test of differences between
independent correlations, these two correlations were significantly different from one another, z
= 2.13, p < .05. Yet, even in first year students this correlation is not strong enough to suggest
that ambiguity intolerance and openness are the same, pointing to the merit of studying both.
Similarly, the correlations among the subjective well-being indicators suggest that they differ
from one another; hence they should be examined separately. Although a few of these
correlations can be considered very high (.72 for negative affect and anxiety for advanced
students), they cannot be considered multicollinear according to Tabachnick and Fidell (2007).
Finally, the correlations between challenge and threat appraisal, (r = -.31 and -.40 in first year
students and advanced students, respectively, both p’s < .01), suggest that one is not the
complete opposite of the other. Therefore, these concepts should also be examined separately

9

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
and they might produce different results. These correlations were not significantly different from
each other, z = 1.27, p = .20.
To examine the relations between the traits and the well-being indicators simultaneously
and to examine the mediating roles of appraisals the data were subjected to multigroup path
analyses, using the software AMOS. The model assessed the direct relations of openness and
ambiguity intolerance to the four indicators of well being, as well as the mediation of challenge
and threat appraisals of these relations. All of the subjective well-being indicators were allowed
to correlate with one another. Because of the gender imbalance in this sample, we entered gender
into the model as a predictor of openness and ambiguity intolerance, thereby ensuring that the
findings would be controlled for gender. The final empirical models with their standard
coefficients are presented in Figure 2. To facilitate focusing on the relations of interest in this
paper, only significant paths are presented in the figures, and gender and covariance are not
presented.
Each model was tested twice: first, all parameters were free to vary across groups. This
analysis was followed by another test with all parameters fixed to be invariant across groups
(Byrne, 2004). The initial test of the multigroup model for openness had a good fit to the data
(χ2/df = 4.025; CFI = .96; NNFI = .95. RMSEA = .077). Openness was positively related to
positive affect both directly and indirectly through challenge appraisals, and it was related to
satisfaction with life indirectly through challenge appraisals. Yet in this study, openness was also
related indirectly to anxiety and negative affect, through threat appraisals. Testing for the
invariance of the model across groups suggested a good fit to the data (χ2/df = 2.814; CFI = .96;
NNFI = .94. RMSEA = .060). A test of difference between the two models showed no significant
difference between free and fixed models [∆χ2 (14) = 22.45, p > .05] suggesting that the

10

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
proposed model is adequate to both first- and advanced-year students. Therefore, with regard to
openness, it appears that it is related to subjective well-being through challenge and threat
appraisals both in the beginning of the university studies and later on.
The same procedure was used to test the model proposed regarding ambiguity intolerance
in both groups. The first multigroup test for ambiguity intolerance had an acceptable fit to the
data (χ2/df = 4.632; CFI = .96; NNFI = .94. RMSEA = .083). For first-year students, intolerance
was positively related to negative affect and to anxiety both directly and indirectly through threat
appraisals. It was also indirectly related to positive affect and life satisfaction through challenge
appraisals. For advanced-year students, however, all direct paths from ambiguity intolerance to
challenge, threat, negative affect, and anxiety were reduced to non-significance, whereas all
other associations remain. Testing for the invariance of the model across groups suggested a
poorer, but still acceptable fit to the data (χ2/df = 3.271; CFI = .94; NNFI = .92. RMSEA = .067).
A test of difference between the two models found a significant difference between free and
fixed models [∆χ2 (14) = 28.18, p < .05]. These results suggest that the model is not adequate for
both groups. Thus, the suggested relationships between ambiguity intolerance and subjective
well-being are clearly specific to the beginning of the university studies.

Discussion
As we suggested, in the beginning of university studies, ambiguity intolerance and
openness were both related to challenge and threat appraisals and these appraisals mediated the
relations of these traits to well-being. However, after the novelty of the situation has faded,
ambiguity intolerance and openness differed in their pattern of associations. Later in this life
situation, openness was still related to both challenge and threat appraisals, whereas ambiguity

11

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
intolerance was not related to any of the proposed appraisals or to well-being. We next discuss
this differential pattern of results in the beginning of this life transition vs. later on.
Ambiguity intolerance was related to challenge and threat appraisals only in first year
students, and it was only related to subjective well-being in first year students compared with
advanced students. Thus, it is clearly relevant mainly in the beginning of a life transition.
Openness, however, was similarly related to well-being and to challenge and threat appraisals in
beginning of this life transition as well as later on. Openness is a broader trait than ambiguity
intolerance and therefore has multiple aspects including a component of novelty and a
component of intellect. The aspect of novelty in the trait openness may have been relevant to
well-being at the beginning of university studies, whereas the aspect of intellect may have been
relevant both in the beginning of university studies and later on. This possibility should be tested
directly in future research using facets of openness of the NEO-PI-R (Costa & McCrae, 1992)
predicting that the actions facet would be particularly relevant to subjective well-being at the
beginning of university studies whereas the ideas facet would be particularly relevant to
subjective well-being later on at university. In addition, future research should examine the
proposed relations on a transition to a life situation that does not require intellect or any other
aspect of openness, such as the transition to a new job that does not require intellectual or
emotional openness.
The current findings add to our understanding of person-environment fit and well-being.
It suggests that people have higher well-being when they are in a life situation that matches their
traits. This was evident in the finding that compared with individuals low on ambiguity
intolerance, those high on this trait had higher levels of well-being in the beginning of a life
transition, but not later on.

12

Openness and Ambiguity Intolerance
More broadly, the current set of findings contributes to our understanding of personsituation interactions, particularly in the area of well-being, thereby supporting calls for more
research that considers contexts, in order to achieve a more sophisticated understanding of how
personality manifests itself (e.g., Borkenau, Riemann, Spinath, & Angleitner, 2006; Cervone,
2005; Shoda , Lee Tiernan, & Mischel, 2002).
Our study demonstrates that the relations between personality and well-being can be
dependent on context, and that such contextual relations are mediated by appraisals of the
situation. It suggests that the field could benefit from more research that examines contextual
relations between personality and well-being in order to progress toward better integration of the
person and the situation.
