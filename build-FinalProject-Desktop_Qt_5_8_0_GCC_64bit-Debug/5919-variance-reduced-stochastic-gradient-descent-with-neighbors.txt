Abstract
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a workhorse in machine learning, yet its
slow convergence can be a computational bottleneck. Variance reduction techniques such as SAG, SVRG and SAGA have been proposed to overcome this
weakness, achieving linear convergence. However, these methods are either based
on computations of full gradients at pivot points, or on keeping per data point corrections in memory. Therefore speed-ups relative to SGD may need a minimal
number of epochs in order to materialize. This paper investigates algorithms that
can exploit neighborhood structure in the training data to share and re-use information about past stochastic gradients across data points, which offers advantages
in the transient optimization phase. As a side-product we provide a unified convergence analysis for a family of variance reduction algorithms, which we call
memorization algorithms. We provide experimental results supporting our theory.

Introduction

We consider a general problem that is pervasive in machine learning, namely optimization of an empirical or regularized convex risk function. Given a convex loss l and a µ-strongly convex regularizer
Ω, one aims at finding a parameter vector w which minimizes the (empirical) expectation:
n

∗

w = argmin f (w),
w

1X
f (w) =
fi (w),
n i=1

fi (w) := l(w, (xi , yi )) + Ω(w) .

(1)

We assume throughout that each fi has L-Lipschitz-continuous gradients. Steepest descent can
find the minimizer w∗ , but requires repeated computations of full gradients f 0 (w), which becomes
prohibitive for massive data sets. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular alternative, in
particular in the context of large-scale learning [2, 10]. SGD updates only involve fi0 (w) for an index
i chosen uniformly at random, providing an unbiased gradient estimate, since Efi0 (w) = f 0 (w).
It is a surprising recent finding [11, 5, 9, 6] that the finite sum structure of f allows for significantly
faster convergence in expectation. Instead of the standard O(1/t) rate of SGD for strongly-convex
functions, it is possible to obtain linear convergence with geometric rates. While SGD requires
asymptotically vanishing learning rates, often chosen to be O(1/t) [7], these more recent methods
introduce corrections that ensure convergence for constant learning rates.
Based on the work mentioned above, the contributions of our paper are as follows: First, we define a family of variance reducing SGD algorithms, called memorization algorithms, which includes
SAGA and SVRG as special cases, and develop a unifying analysis technique for it. Second, we
1

1
show geometric rates for all step sizes γ < 4L
, including a universal (µ-independent) step size
choice, providing the first µ-adaptive convergence proof for SVRG. Third, based on the above analysis, we present new insights into the trade-offs between freshness and biasedness of the corrections
computed from previous stochastic gradients. Fourth, we propose a new class of algorithms that
resolves this trade-off by computing corrections based on stochastic gradients at neighboring points.
We experimentally show its benefits in the regime of learning with a small number of epochs.

Memorization Algorithms
Algorithms

Variance Reduced SGD Given an optimization problem as in (1), we investigate a class of
stochastic gradient descent algorithms that generates an iterate sequence wt (t ≥ 0) with updates
taking the form:
w+ = w − γgi (w), gi (w) = fi0 (w) − ᾱi with ᾱi := αi − ᾱ,
(2)
P
n
where ᾱ := n1 j=1 αj . Here w is the current and w+ the new parameter vector, γ is the step size,
and i is an index selected uniformly at random. ᾱi are variance correction terms such that Eᾱi = 0,
which guarantees unbiasedness Egi (w) = f 0 (w). The aim is to define updates of asymptotically
vanishing variance, i.e. gi (w) → 0 as w → w∗ , which requires ᾱi → fi0 (w∗ ). This implies that
corrections need to be designed in a way to exactly cancel out the stochasticity of fi0 (w∗ ) at the
optimum. How the memory αj is updated distinguishes the different algorithms that we consider.
SAGA The SAGA algorithm [4] maintains variance corrections αi by memorizing stochastic gradients. The update rule is αi+ = fi0 (w) for the selected i, and αj+ = αj , for j 6= i. Note that
these corrections will be used the next time the same index i gets sampled. Setting ᾱi := αi − ᾱ
guarantees unbiasedness. Obviously, ᾱ can be updated incrementally. SAGA reuses the stochastic
gradient fi0 (w) computed at step t to update w as well as ᾱi .
q-SAGA We also consider q-SAGA, a method that updates q ≥ 1 randomly chosen αj variables
at each iteration. This is a convenient reference point to investigate the advantages of “fresher”
corrections. Note that in SAGA the corrections will be on average n iterations “old”. In q-SAGA
this can be controlled to be n/q at the expense of additional gradient computations.
SVRG We reformulate a variant of SVRG [5] in our framework using a randomization argument
similar to (but simpler than) the one suggested in [6]. Fix q > 0 and draw in each iteration r ∼
Uniform[0; 1). If r < q/n, a complete update, αj+ = fj0 (w) (∀j) is performed, otherwise they are
left unchanged. While q-SAGA updates exactly q variables in each iteration, SVRG occasionally
updates all α variables by triggering an additional sweep through the data. There is an option to not
maintain α variables explicitly and to save on space by storing only ᾱ = f 0 (w) and w.
Uniform Memorization Algorithms Motivated by SAGA and SVRG, we define a class of algorithms, which we call uniform memorization algorithms.
Definition 1. A uniform q-memorization algorithm evolves iterates w according to Eq. (2) and
selects in each iteration a random index set J of memory locations to update according to
 0
fj (w) if j ∈ J
+
αj :=
(3)
αj
otherwise,
P
such that any j has the same probability of q/n of being updated, i.e. ∀j, J3j P{J} = nq .

Note that q-SAGA and the above SVRG are special cases. For q-SAGA: P{J} = 1/ nq if |J| = q
P{J} = 0 otherwise. For SVRG: P{∅} = 1 − q/n, P{[1 : n]} = q/n, P{J} = 0, otherwise.
N -SAGA Because we need it in Section 3, we will also define an algorithm, which we call N SAGA, which makes use of a neighborhood system Ni ⊆ {1, . . . , n} and which selects neighborhoods uniformly, i.e. P{Ni } = n1 . Note that Definition 1 requires |{i : j ∈ Ni }| = q (∀j).
2

Finally, note that for generalized linear models where fi depends on xi only through hw, xi i, we
get fi0 (w) = ξi0 (w)xi , i.e. the update direction is determined by xi , whereas the effective step length
depends on the derivative of a scalar function ξi (w). As used in [9], this leads to significant memory
savings as one only needs to store the scalars ξi0 (w) as xi is always given when performing an update.
2.2

Analysis

Recurrence of Iterates The evolution equation (2) in expectation implies the recurrence (by crucially using the unbiasedness condition Egi (w) = f 0 (w)):
Ekw+ −w∗ k2 = kw − w∗ k2 − 2γhf 0 (w), w − w∗ i + γ 2 Ekgi (w)k2 .

(4)

Here and in the rest of this paper, expectations are always taken only with respect to i (conditioned
on the past). We utilize a number of bounds (see [4]), which exploit strong convexity of f (wherever
µ appears) as well as Lipschitz continuity of the fi -gradients (wherever L appears):
hf 0 (w), w − w∗ i ≥ f (w) − f (w∗ ) + µ2 kw − w∗ k2 ,

Eq. (6) can be generalized [4] using kx±yk ≤ (1+β)kxk +(1+β )kyk with β > 0. However
for the sake of simplicity, we sacrifice tightness and choose β = 1. Applying all of the above yields:
Lemma 1. For the iterate sequence of any algorithm that evolves solutions according to Eq. (2), the
following holds for a single update step, in expectation over the choice of i:

kw − w∗ k2 − Ekw+ − w∗ k2 ≥ γµkw − w∗ k2 − 2γ 2 Ekαi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 + 2γ − 4γ 2 L f δ (w) .
All proofs are deferred to the Appendix.
Ideal and Approximate Variance Correction Note that in the ideal case of αi = fi0 (w∗ ), we
1
, yielding a rate of 1 − ρ
would immediately get a condition for a contraction by choosing γ = 2L
µ
with ρ = γµ = 2L
, which is half the inverse of the condition number κ := L/µ.
How can we further bound Ekαi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 in the case of “non-ideal” variance-reducing SGD? A
key insight is that for memorization algorithms, we can apply the smoothness bound in Eq. (7)
kαi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 = kfi0 (wτi ) − fi0 (w∗ )k2 ≤ 2Lhi (wτi ),

(where wτi is old w) .

(10)

2

Note that if we only had approximations βi in the sense that kβi − αi k ≤ i (see Section 3), then
we can use kx − yk ≤ 2kxk + 2kyk to get the somewhat worse bound:
kβi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 ≤ 2kαi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 + 2kβi − αi k2 ≤ 4Lhi (wτi ) + 2i .

(11)

Lyapunov Function Ideally, we would like to show that for a suitable choice of γ, each iteration
results in a contraction Ekw+ − w∗ k2 ≤ (1 − ρ)kw − w∗ k2 , where 0 < ρ ≤ 1. However, the main
challenge arises from the fact that the quantities αi represent stochastic gradients from previous iterations. This requires a somewhat more complex proof technique. Adapting the Lyapunov function
method from [4], we define upper bounds Hi ≥ kαi − fi0 (w∗ )k2 such that Hi → 0 as w → w∗ . We
start with αi0 = 0 and (conceptually) initialize Hi = kfi0 (w∗ )k2 , and then update Hi in sync with αi ,

2L hi (w) if αi is updated

This is a simplified version of the one appearing in [4], as we assume f 0 (w∗ ) = 0 (unconstrained regime).

In expectation under a random update, the Lyapunov function Lσ changes as ELσ (w+ , H + ) =
Ekw+ − w∗ k2 + Sσ EH̄ + . We can readily apply Lemma 1 to bound the first part. The second part
is due to (12), which mirrors the update of the α variables. By crucially using the property that any
αj has the same probability of being updated in (3), we get the following result:

Note that in expectation the shrinkage does not depend on the location of previous iterates wτ and
the new increment is proportional to the sub-optimality of the current iterate w. Technically, this is
how the possibly complicated dependency on previous iterates is dealt with in an effective manner.
Convergence Analysis We first state our main Lemma about Lyapunov function contractions:
Lemma 3. Fix c ∈ (0; 1] and σ ∈ [0; 1] arbitrarily. For any uniform q-memorization algorithm with
sufficiently small step size γ such that

By maximizing the bounds in Lemma 3 over the choices of c and σ, we obtain our main result that

As the optimal choice of γ depends on K, i.e. µ, we would prefer step sizes that are µ-independent,
thus giving rates that adapt to the local curvature (see [9]). It turns out that by choosing a step size

Sharing Gradient Memory
-Approximation Analysis

As we have seen, fresher gradient memory, i.e. a larger choice for q, affects the guaranteed convergence rate as ρ ∼ q/n. However, as long as one step of a q-memorization algorithm is as expensive
as q steps of a 1-memorization algorithm, this insight does not lead to practical improvements per
se. Yet, it raises the question, whether we can accelerate these methods, in particular N -SAGA,
by approximating gradients stored in the αi variables. Note
P that we are always using the correct
stochastic gradients in the current update and by assuring i ᾱi = 0, we will not introduce any bias
in the update direction. Rather, we lose the guarantee of asymptotically vanishing variance at w∗ .
However, as we will show, it is possible to retain geometric rates up to a δ-ball around w∗ .
We will focus on SAGA-style updates for concreteness and investigate an algorithm that mirrors N SAGA with the only difference that it maintains approximations βi to the true αi variables. We aim
to guarantee Ekαi − βi k2 ≤  and will use Eq. (11) to modify the right-hand-side of Lemma 1. We
see that approximation errors i are multiplied with γ 2 , which implies that we should aim for small
learning rates, ideally without compromising the N -SAGA rate. From Theorem 1 and Corollary 1
we can see that we can choose γ . q/µn for n sufficiently large, which indicates that there is hope
to dampen the effects of the approximations. We now make this argument more precise.
Theorem 2. Consider a uniform q-memorization algorithm with α-updates that are on average accurate (i.e. Ekαi − βi k2 ≤ ). For any step size γ ≤ γ̃(K), where γ̃ is given by Corollary 5 in
the appendix (note that γ̃(K) ≥ 32 γ ∗ (K) and γ̃(K) → γ ∗ (K) as K → 0), we get
4γ
EL(wt , H t ) ≤ (1 − µγ)t L0 +

where E denote the (unconditional) expectation over histories (in contrast to E which is conditional),

and s(γ) := Kµ
(1 − 2Lγ).
Corollary 4. With γ = min{µ, γ̃(K)} we have
4γ
≤ 4,
with a rate ρ = min{µ2 , µγ̃} .
(21)
µ
√
√
In the relevant case of µ ∼ 1/ n, we thus converge towards some -ball around w∗ at a similar
rate as for the exact method. For µ ∼ n−1 , we have√to reduce the step size significantly to compensate the extra variance and to still converge to an -ball, resulting in the slower rate ρ ∼ n−2 ,
instead of ρ ∼ n−1 .
We also note that the geometric convergence of SGD with a constant step size to a neighborhood
of the solution (also proven in [8]) can arise as a special case in our analysis. By setting αi = 0 in
Lemma 1, we can take  = Ekfi0 (w∗ )k2 for SGD. An approximate q-memorization algorithm can
thus be interpreted as making  an algorithmic parameter, rather than a fixed value as in SGD.
3.2

Algorithms

Sharing Gradient Memory We now discuss our proposal of using neighborhoods for sharing
gradient information between close-by data points. Thereby we avoid an increase in gradient computations relative to q- or N -SAGA at the expense of suffering an approximation bias. This leads
to a new tradeoff between freshness and approximation quality, which can be resolved in non-trivial
ways, depending on the desired final optimization accuracy.
We distinguish two types of quantities. First, the gradient memory αi as defined by the reference
algorithm N -SAGA. Second, the shared gradient memory state βi , which is used in a modified
update rule in Eq. (2), i.e. w+ = w − γ(fi0 (w) − βi + β̄). Assume that we select an index i for the
weight update, then we generalize Eq. (3) as follows

In the important case of generalized linear models, where one has fi0 (w) = ξi0 (w)xi , we can modify
the relevant case in Eq. (22) by βj+ := ξi0 (w)xj . This has the advantages of using the correct
direction, while reducing storage requirements.
5

Approximation Bounds For our analysis, we need to control the error kαi − βi k2 ≤ i . This
obviously requires problem-specific investigations.
Let us first look at the case of ridge regression. fi (w) := 21 (hxi , wi − yi )2 + λ2 kwk2 and thus
fi0 (w) = ξi0 (w)xi + λw with ξi0 (w) := hxi , wi − yi . Considering j ∈ Ni being updated, we have
kαj+ − βj+ k = |ξj0 (w) − ξi0 (w)|kxj k ≤ (δij kwk + |yj − yi |) kxj k =: ij (w)
(23)
where δij := kxi − xj k. Note that this can be pre-computed with the exception of the norm kwk
that we only know at the time of an update.
Similarly, for regularized logistic regression with y ∈ {−1, 1}, we have ξi0 (w) = yi /(1 + eyi hxi ,wi ).
With the requirement on neighbors that yi = yj we get
eδij kwk − 1
kxj k =: ij (w)
1 + e−hxi ,wi
Again, we can pre-compute δij and kxj k. In addition to ξi0 (w) we can also store hxi , wi.
kαj+ − βj+ k ≤

(24)

N -SAGA We can use these bounds in two ways. First, assuming that the iterates stay within a
norm-ball (e.g. L2 -ball), we can derive upper bounds
1X
j (r) ≥ max{ij (w) : j ∈ Ni , kwk ≤ r},
(r) =
j (r) .
(25)
n j
Obviously, the more compact the neighborhoods are, the smaller (r). This is most useful for the
analysis. Second, we can specify a target accuracy  and then prune neighborhoods dynamically.
This approach is more practically relevant as it allows us to directly control . However, a dynamically varying neighborhood violates Definition 1. We fix this in a sound manner by modifying the
memory updates as follows:
 0
fi (w) if j ∈ Ni and ij (w) ≤ 
βj+ := fj0 (w) if j ∈ Ni and ij (w) > 
(26)

βj
otherwise
This allows us to interpolate between sharing more aggressively (saving computation) and performing more computations in an exact manner. In the limit of  → 0, we recover N -SAGA, as  → max
we recover the first variant mentioned.
Computing Neighborhoods Note that the pairwise Euclidean distances show up in the bounds in
Eq. (23) and (24). In the classification case we also require yi = yj , whereas in the ridge regression
case, we also want |yi − yj | to be small. Thus modulo filtering, this suggests the use of Euclidean
distances as the metric for defining neighborhoods. Standard approximation techniques for finding
near(est) neighbors can be used. This comes with a computational overhead, yet the additional costs
will amortize over multiple runs or multiple data analysis tasks.

Experimental Results

Algorithms We present experimental results on the performance of the different variants of memorization algorithms for variance reduced SGD as discussed in this paper. SAGA has been uniformly
superior to SVRG in our experiments, so we compare SAGA and N -SAGA (from Eq. (26)), alongside with SGD as a straw man and q-SAGA as a point of reference for speed-ups. We have chosen
q = 20 for q-SAGA and N -SAGA. The same setting was used across all data sets and experiments.
Data Sets As special cases for the choice of the loss function and regularizer in Eq. (1), we consider two commonly occurring problems in machine learning, namely least-square regression and
`2 -regularized logistic regression. We apply least-square regression on the million song year regression from the UCI repository. This dataset contains n = 515, 345 data points, each described by
d = 90 input features. We apply logistic regression on the cov and ijcnn1 datasets obtained from
the libsvm website 2 . The cov dataset contains n = 581, 012 data points, each described by d = 54
input features. The ijcnn1 dataset contains n = 49, 990 data points, each described by d = 22 input
features. We added an `2 -regularizer Ω(w) = µkwk22 to ensure the objective is strongly convex.

Figure 1: Comparison of N -SAGA, q-SAGA, SAGA and SGD (with decreasing and constant step
size) on three datasets. The top two rows show the suboptimality as a function of the number
of gradient evaluations for two different values of µ = 10−1 , 10−3 . The bottom two rows show
the suboptimality as a function of the number of datapoint evaluations (i.e. number of stochastic
updates) for two different values of µ = 10−1 , 10−3 .

Experimental Protocol We have run the algorithms in question in an i.i.d. sampling setting and
averaged the results over 5 runs. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the suboptimality f δ of the objective as a function of two different metrics: (1) in terms of the number of update steps performed
(“datapoint evaluation”), and (2) in terms of the number of gradient computations (“gradient evaluation”). Note that SGD and SAGA compute one stochastic gradient per update step unlike q-SAGA,
which is included here not as a practically relevant algorithm, but as an indication of potential imq
provements that could be achieved by fresher corrections. A step size γ = µn
was used everywhere,
except for “plain SGD”. Note that as K  1 in all cases, this is close to the optimal value suggested
by our analysis; moreover, using a step size of ∼ L1 for SAGA as suggested in previous work [9]
did not appear to give better results. For plain SGD, we used a schedule of the form γt = γ0 /t with
constants optimized coarsely via cross-validation. The x-axis is expressed in units of n (suggestively
called ”epochs”).
SAGA vs. SGD cst As we can see, if we run SGD with the same constant step size as SAGA,
it takes several epochs until SAGA really shows a significant gain. The constant step-size variant
of SGD is faster in the early stages until it converges to a neighborhood of the optimum, where
individual runs start showing a very noisy behavior.
SAGA vs. q-SAGA q-SAGA outperforms plain SAGA quite consistently when counting stochastic update steps. This establishes optimistic reference curves of what we can expect to achieve with
N -SAGA. The actual speed-up is somewhat data set dependent.
N -SAGA vs. SAGA and q-SAGA N -SAGA with sufficiently small  can realize much of the
possible freshness gains of q-SAGA and performs very similar for a few (2-10) epochs, where it
traces nicely between the SAGA and q-SAGA curves. We see solid speed-ups on all three datasets
for both µ = 0.1 and µ = 0.001.
Asymptotics It should be clearly stated that running N -SAGA at a fixed  for longer will not
result in good asymptotics on the empirical risk. This is because, as theory predicts, N -SAGA
can not drive the suboptimality to zero, but rather levels-off at a point determined by . In our
experiments, the cross-over point with SAGA was typically after 5 − 15 epochs. Note that the gains
in the first epochs can be significant, though. In practice, one will either define a desired accuracy
level and choose  accordingly or one will switch to SAGA for accurate convergence.

Conclusion

We have generalized variance reduced SGD methods under the name of memorization algorithms
and presented a corresponding analysis, which commonly applies to all such methods. We have
investigated in detail the range of safe step sizes with their corresponding geometric rates as guaranteed by our theory. This has delivered a number of new insights, for instance about the trade-offs
1
between small (∼ n1 ) and large (∼ 4L
) step sizes in different regimes as well as about the role of
the freshness of stochastic gradients evaluated at past iterates.
We have also investigated and quantified the effect of additional errors in the variance correction
terms on the convergence behavior. Dependent on how µ scales with n, we have shown that such
errors can be tolerated, yet, for small µ, may have a negative effect on the convergence rate as much
smaller step sizes are needed to still guarantee convergence to a small region. We believe this result
to be relevant for a number of approximation techniques in the context of variance reduced SGD.
Motivated by these insights and results of our analysis, we have proposed N -SAGA, a modification
of SAGA that exploits similarities between training data points by defining a neighborhood system.
Approximate versions of per-data point gradients are then computed by sharing information among
neighbors. This opens-up the possibility of variance-reduction in a streaming data setting, where
each data point is only seen once. We believe this to be a promising direction for future work.
Empirically, we have been able to achieve consistent speed-ups for the initial phase of regularized
risk minimization. This shows that approximate computations of variance correction terms constitutes a promising approach of trading-off computation with solution accuracy.
