Abstract
In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general
low-dimensional structural constraints induced by any norm regularization. We
consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion,
and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation
error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish
two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size
or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a
certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure
of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity
holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further,
we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework,
notably the recently proposed spectral k-support norm.

Introduction

The task of completing the missing entries of a matrix from an incomplete subset of (potentially
noisy) entries is encountered in many applications including recommendation systems, data imputation, covariance matrix estimation, and sensor localization among others. Traditionally ill–posed
high dimensional estimation problems, where the number of parameters to be estimated is much
higher than the number of observations, has been extensively studied in the recent literature. However, matrix completion problems are particularly ill–posed as the observations are both limited
(high dimensional), and the measurements are extremely localized, i.e., the observations consist of
individual matrix entries. The localized measurement model, in contrast to random Gaussian or
sub–Gaussian measurements, poses additional complications in high dimensional estimation.
For well–posed estimation in high dimensional problems including matrix completion, it is imperative that low dimensional structural constraints are imposed on the target. For matrix completion,
the special case of low–rank constraint has been widely studied. Several existing work propose
tractable estimators with near–optimal recovery guarantees for (approximate) low–rank matrix completion [8, 7, 28, 26, 18, 19, 22, 11, 20, 21]. A recent work [16] addresses the extension to structures
with decomposable norm regularization. However, the scope of matrix completion extends for low
dimensional structures far beyond simple low–rankness or decomposable norm structures.
In this paper, we present a unified statistical analysis of matrix completion under a general set of low
dimensional structures that are induced by any suitable norm regularization. We provide statistical
analysis of two generalized matrix completion estimators, the constrained norm minimizer, and the
generalized matrix Dantzig selector (Section 2.2). The main results in the paper (Theorem 1a–1b)
provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and estimation error of these estimators for
matrix completion under any norm regularization. Existing results on matrix completion with low
rank or other decomposable structures can be obtained as special cases of our general results.

Our unified analysis of sample complexity is motivated by recent work on high dimensional estimation using global (sub) Gaussian measurements [10, 1, 35, 3, 37, 5]. A key ingredient in the recovery
analysis of high dimensional estimation involves establishing a certain variation of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) [9] of the measurement operator. It has been shown that such properties are satisfied by Gaussian and sub–Gaussian measurement operators with high probability. Unfortunately,
as has been noted before by Candes et al. [8], owing to highly localized measurements, such conditions are not satisfied in the matrix completion problem, and the existing results based on global
(sub) Gaussian measurements are not directly applicable. In fact, a key question we consider is:
given the radically limited measurement model in matrix completion, by how much would the sample complexity of estimation increase beyond the known sample complexity bounds for global (sub)
Gaussian measurements. Our results upper bounds the sample complexity for matrix completion to
within a log d factor over that for estimation under global (sub) Gaussian measurements [10, 3, 5].
While the result was previously known for low rank matrix completion using nuclear norm minimization [26, 20], with a careful use of generic chaining, we show that the log d factor suffices
for structures induced by any norm! As a key intermediate result, we show that a useful form of
restricted strong convexity (RSC) [27] holds for the localized measurements encountered in matrix
completion under general norm regularized structures. The result substantially generalizes existing
RSC results for matrix completion under the special cases of nuclear norm and decomposable norm
regularization [26, 16].
For our analysis, we use tools from generic chaining [33] to characterize the main results (Theorem 1a–1b) in terms of the Gaussian width (Definition 1) of certain error sets. Gaussian widths
provide a powerful geometric characterization for quantifying the complexity of a structured low dimensional subset in a high dimensional ambient space. Numerous tools have been developed in the
literature for bounding the Gaussian width of structured sets. A unified characterization of results in
terms of Gaussian width has the advantage that this literature can be readily leveraged to derive new
recovery guarantees for matrix completion under suitable structural constraints (Appendix D.2).
In addition to the theoretical elegance of such a unified framework, identifying useful but potentially
non–decomposable low dimensional structures is of significant practical interest. The broad class
of structures enforced through symmetric convex bodies and symmetric atomic sets [10] can be
analyzed under this paradigm (Section 2.1). Such specialized structures can capture the constraints
in certain applications better than simple low–rankness. In particular, we discuss in detail, a non–
trivial example of the spectral k–support norm introduced by McDonald et al. [25].
To summarize the key contributions of the paper:
• Theorem 1a–1b provide unified upper bounds on sample complexity and estimation error for
matrix completion estimators using general norm regularization: a substantial generalization of the
existing results on matrix completion under structural constraints.
• Theorem 1a is applied to derive statistical results for the special case of matrix completion under
spectral k–support norm regularization.
• An intermediate result, Theorem 5 shows that under any norm regularization, a variant of Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) holds in the matrix completion setting with extremely localized
measurements. Further, a certain partial measure of complexity of a set is encountered in matrix
completion analysis (12). Another intermediate result, Theorem 2 provides bounds on the partial complexity measures in terms of a better understood complexity measure of Gaussian width.
These intermediate results are of independent interest beyond the scope of the paper.

Structured Matrix Completion

Denote the ground truth target matrix as Θ∗ ∈ Rd1×d2 ; let d = d1 + d2 . In the noisy matrix completion, observations consists of individual entries of Θ∗ observed through an additive noise channel.
Sub–Gaussian Noise: Given, a list of independently sampled standard basis Ω = {Ek = eik e>
jk :
ik ∈ [d1 ], jk ∈ [d2 ]} with potential duplicates, observations (yk )k ∈ R|Ω| are given by:
yk = hΘ∗ , Ek i + ξηk , for k = 1, 2, . . . , |Ω|,
(5)
|Ω|
where η ∈ R is the noise vector of independent sub–Gaussian random variables with E[ηk ] = 0
and Var(ηk ) = 1, and ξ 2 is scaled variance of noise per observation. Further let kηk kΨ2 ≤ b for a
constant b (recall k.kΨ2 from Definition 2). Also, without loss of generality, assume normalization
kΘ∗ kF = 1.
Uniform Sampling: Assume that the entries in Ω are drawn independently and uniformly:
Ek ∼ uniform{ei e>
(6)
j : i ∈ [d1 ], j ∈ [d2 ]}, for Ek ∈ Ω.
Let {ek } be the standard basis of R|Ω| . Given Ω, define PΩ : Rd1×d2 → R|Ω| as:
P|Ω|
PΩ (X) = k=1 hX, Ek iek
(7)
Structural Constraints For matrix completion with |Ω| < d1 d2 , low dimensional structural constraints on Θ∗ are necessary for well–posedness. We consider a generalized constraint setting
wherein for some low–dimensional model space M, Θ∗ ∈ M is enforced through a surrogate
norm regularizer R(.). We make no further assumptions on R other than it being a norm in Rd1×d2 .
Low Spikiness In matrix completion under uniform sampling model, further restrictions on Θ∗ (beyond low dimensional structure) are required to ensure that the most informative entries of the matrix
are observed with high probability [8]. Early work assumed stringent matrix incoherence conditions
for low–rank completion to preclude such matrices [7, 18, 19], while more recent work [11, 26], relax these assumptions to a more intuitive restriction of the spikiness ratio, defined in (3). However,
under this relaxation only an approximate recovery is typically guaranteed in low–noise regime, as
opposed to near exact recovery under incoherence assumptions [26, 11].

Special Cases and Applications

We briefly introduce some interesting examples of structural constraints with practical applications.
Example 1 (Low Rank and Decomposable Norms). Low–rankness is the most common structure
used in many matrix estimation problems including collaborative filtering, PCA, spectral clustering,
etc. Convex estimators using nuclear norm kΘk∗ regularization has been widely studied statistically
[8, 7, 28, 26, 18, 19, 22, 11, 20, 21]. A recent work [16] extends the analysis of low rank matrix
completion to general decomposable norms, i.e. R : ∀X, Y ∈ (M, M⊥ ), R(X+Y ) = R(X)+R(Y ).
Example 2 (Spectral k–support Norm). A non–trivial and significant example of norm regularization that is not decomposable is the spectral k–support norm recently introduced by McDonald et al. [25]. Spectral k–support norm is essentially the vector k–support norm [2] applied on the
singular values σ(Θ) of a matrix Θ ∈ Rd1×d2 . Without loss of generality, let d¯ = d1 = d2 .
¯ : |g| ≤ k} be the set of all subsets [d]
¯ of cardinality at most k, and let
Let Gk = {g ⊆ [d]
d¯
V(Gk ) = {(vg )g∈Gk : vg ∈ R , supp(vg ) ⊆ g}. The spectral k–support norm is given by:
nX
o
X
kΘkk–sp = inf
kvg k2 :
vg = σ(Θ) ,
(8)
v∈V(Gk )

g∈Gk

g∈Gk

McDonald et al. [25] showed that spectral k–support norm is a special case of cluster norm [17]. It
was further shown that in multi–task learning, wherein the tasks (columns of Θ∗ ) are assumed to be
clustered into dense groups, the cluster norm provides a trade–off between intra–cluster variance,
(inverse) inter–cluster variance, and the norm of the task vectors. Both [17] and [25] demonstrate
superior empirical performance of cluster norms (and k–support norm) over traditional trace norm
and spectral elastic net minimization on bench marked matrix completion and multi–task learning
datasets. However, statistical analysis of consistent matrix completion using spectral k–support
norm regularization has not been previously studied. In Section 3.2, we discuss the consequence of
our main theorem for this non–trivial special case.
Example 3 (Additive Decomposition). Elementwise sparsity is a common structure often assumed
in high–dimensional estimation problems. However, in matrix completion, elementwise sparsity
conflicts with Assumption 1 (and more traditional incoherence assumptions). Indeed, it is easy to
see that with high probability most of the |Ω|  d1 d2 uniformly sampled observations will be
zero, and an informed prediction is infeasible. However, elementwise sparse
P structures can often
be modelled within an additive decomposition framework, wherein Θ∗ = k Θ(k) , such that each
component matrix Θ(k) is in turn structured (e.g. low rank+sparse used for robust PCA [6]). In
such structures, there is no scope for recovering sparse components outside the observed indices,
and it is assumed that: Θ(k) is sparse ⇒ supp(Θ(k) ) ⊆ Ω. In such cases, our results are applicable
under additional regularity assumptions that enforces non–spikiness on the superposed matrix. A
candidate norm regularizer for such structures is the weighted infimum convolution of individual
structure inducing norms [6, 39],

Example 4 (Other Applications). Other potential applications including cut matrices [30, 10], structures induced by compact convex sets, norms inducing structured sparsity assumptions on the spectrum of Θ∗ , etc. can also be handled under the paradigm of this paper.

where recall that PΩ∗ : RΩ → Rd1×d2 is the linear adjoint of PΩ , i.e. hPΩ (X), yi = hX, PΩ∗ (y)i.
Note: Theorem 1a–1b gives consistency results for (9) and (10), respectively, under certain conditions on the parameters λcn > 0, λds > 0, and α∗ > 1. In particular, these conditions assume
knowledge of the noise variance ξ 2 and spikiness ratio αsp (Θ∗ ). In practice, typically ξ and αsp (Θ∗ )
are unknown and the parameters are tuned by validating on held out data.

For both estimators, upper bound on sample complexity is dominated by the square of Gaussian
width which is often considered the effective dimension of a subset in high dimensional space
and plays a key role in high dimensional estimation under Gaussian measurement ensembles.
The results show that, independent of R(.), the upper bound on sample complexity for consistent
matrix completion with highly localized measurements is within a log d factor of the known
2
sample complexity of ∼ wG
(ER ) for estimation from Gaussian measurements [3, 10, 37, 5].
First term in estimation error bounds in Theorem 1a–1b scales with ξ 2 which is the per observation noise variance (upto constant). The second term is an upper bound on error that arises due
to unidentifiability of Θ∗ within a certain radius under the spikiness constraints [26]; in contrast
[7] show exact recovery when ξ = 0 using more stringent matrix incoherence conditions.

matrix completion under non–low–noise regime, where the first term dominates, and those of [10,

35] for high dimensional estimation under Gaussian measurements. With a bound on wG
(ER ), it
is easy to specialize this result for new structural constraints. However, this bound is potentially
loose and asymptotically converges to a constant error proportional to the noise variance ξ 2 .
The estimation error bound in Theorem 1b is typically sharper than that in Theorem 1a. However,
for specific structures, using application of Theorem 1b requires additional bounds on R∗ PΩ∗ (η)

Partial Complexity Measures

Recall that for wG (S) = E supX∈S hX, Gi and R|Ω| 3 g ∼ N (0, I|Ω| ) is a standard normal vector.
Definition 6 (Partial Complexity Measures). Given a randomly sampled Ω = {Ek ∈ Rd1×d2 }, and
a centered random vector η ∈ R|Ω| , the partial η–complexity measure of S is given by:
wΩ,η (S) = EΩ,η sup hX, PΩ∗ (η)i.

X∈S−S

Special cases of η being a vector of standard Gaussian g, or standard Rademacher  (i.e. k ∈
{−1, 1} w.p. 1/2) variables, are of particular interest.
Note: In the case of symmetric η, like g and , wΩ,η (S) = 2EΩ,η supX∈S hX, PΩ∗ (η)i, and the later
expression will be used interchangeably ignoring the constant term.

Spectral k–Support Norm

We introduced spectral k–support norm in Section 2.1. The estimators from (9) and (10) for spectral
k–support norm can be efficiently solved via proximal methods using the proximal operators derived
in [25]. We are interested in the statistical guarantees for matrix completion using spectral k–support
norm regularization. We extend the analysis for upper bounding the Gaussian width of the descent
cone for the vector k–support norm by [29] to the case of spectral k–support norm. WLOG let

Discussions and Related Work

Sample Complexity: For consistent recovery in high dimensional convex estimation, it is desirable
that the descent cone at the target parameter Θ∗ is “small” relative to the feasible set (enforced by the
observations) of the estimator. Thus, it is not surprising that the sample complexity and estimation
error bounds of an estimator depends on some measure of complexity/size of the error cone at
Θ∗ . Results in this paper are largely characterized in terms of a widely used complexity measure
of Gaussian width wG (.), and can be compared with the literature on estimation from Gaussian
measurements.
Error Bounds: Theorem 1a provides estimation error bounds that depends only on the Gaussian
width of the descent cone. In non–low–noise regime, this result is comparable to analogous results
of constrained norm minimization [6, 10, 35]. However, this bound is potentially loose owing to
mismatched data–fit term using squared loss, and asymptotically converges to a constant error proportional to the noise variance ξ 2 .
6

A tighter analysis on the estimation error can be obtained for the matrix Dantzig selector (10) from
Theorem 1b. However, application of Theorem 1b requires computing high probability upper bound
on R∗ PΩ∗ (η). The literature on norms of random matrices [13, 24, 36, 34] can be exploited in computing such bounds. Beside, in special cases: if R(.) ≥ Kk.k∗ , then KR∗ (.) ≤ k.kop can be used
to obtain asymptotically consistent results.
Finally, under near zero–noise, the second term in the results of Theorem 1 dominates, and bounds
are weaker than that of [6, 19] owing to the relaxation of stronger incoherence assumption.
Related Work and Future Directions: The closest related work is the result on consistency of
matrix completion under decomposable norm regularization by [16]. Results in this paper are a strict
generalization to general norm regularized (not necessarily decomposable) matrix completion. We
provide non–trivial examples of application where structures enforced by such non–decomposable
norms are of interest. Further, in contrast to our results that are based on Gaussian width, the RSC
parameter in [16] depends on a modified complexity measure κR (d, |Ω|) (see definition in [16]). An
advantage of results based on Gaussian width is that, application of Theorem 1 for special cases can
greatly benefit from the numerous tools in the literature for the computation of wG (.).
Another closely related line of work is the non–asymptotic analysis of high dimensional estimation
under random Gaussian or sub–Gaussian measurements [10, 1, 35, 3, 37, 5]. However, the analysis
from this literature rely on variants of RIP of the measurement ensemble [9], which is not satisfied by
the the extremely localized measurements encountered in matrix completion[8]. In an intermediate
result, we establish a form of RSC for matrix completion under general norm regularization: a result
that was previously known only for nuclear norm and decomposable norm regularization.
In future work, it is of interest to derive matching lower bounds on estimation error for matrix
completion under general low dimensional structures, along the lines of [22, 5] and explore special
case applications of the results in the paper. We also plan to derive explicit characterization of λds
in terms of Gaussian width of unit balls by exploiting generic chaining results for general Banach
spaces [33].

Recall TR and ER from (11). The most significant step in the proof of Theorem 1 involves showing
that over a useful subset of TR , a form of RSC (2) is satisfied by a squared loss penalty.

Proof of Theorem 2

|Ω|
Let the entries of Ω = {Ek = eik e>
jk : k = 1, 2, . . . , |Ω|} be sampled as in (6). Recall that g ∈ R
is a standard normal vector. For a compact S ⊆ Rd1×d2 , it suffices to prove Theorem 2 for a dense
countable subset of S. Overloading S to such a countable subset, define following random process:
P
(XΩ,g (X))X∈S , where XΩ,g (X) = hX, PΩ∗ (g)i = k hX, Ek igk .
(18)

We start with a key lemma in the proof of Theorem 2. Proof of this lemma, provided in Appendix B,
uses tools from the broad topic of generic chaining developed in recent works [31, 33].
Lemma 8. For a compact subset Ss⊆ Rd1×d2 with non–empty interior, ∃ constants k1 , k2 such that:
r

wG (S) + k2 E sup kPΩ (X − Y )k22 .

wΩ,g (S) = E sup XΩ,g (X) ≤ k1
d1 d2
X,Y ∈S
X∈S
Lemma 9. There exists constants k3 , k4 , such that for compact S ⊆ Bd1 d2 with non–empty interior
E sup kPΩ (X − Y )k22 ≤ k3
X,Y ∈S

|Ω| 2
w (S) + k4 ( sup kX − Y k∞ )wΩ,g (S)
d1 d2 G
X,Y ∈S

Theorem
2 follows by combining Lemma 8 and Lemma 9, and simple algebraic manipulations using
√
ab ≤ a/2 + b/2 and triangle inequality (See Appendix B.4).
The statement in Theorem 2 about partial sub–Gaussian complexity follows from a standard result
in empirical process given in Lemma 11 in the appendix.
