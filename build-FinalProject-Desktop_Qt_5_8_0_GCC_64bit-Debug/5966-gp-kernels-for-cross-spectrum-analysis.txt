Abstract
Multi-output Gaussian processes provide a convenient framework for multi-task
problems. An illustrative and motivating example of a multi-task problem is
multi-region electrophysiological time-series data, where experimentalists are interested in both power and phase coherence between channels. Recently, Wilson
and Adams (2013) proposed the spectral mixture (SM) kernel to model the spectral density of a single task in a Gaussian process framework. In this paper, we
develop a novel covariance kernel for multiple outputs, called the cross-spectral
mixture (CSM) kernel. This new, flexible kernel represents both the power and
phase relationship between multiple observation channels. We demonstrate the
expressive capabilities of the CSM kernel through implementation of a Bayesian
hidden Markov model, where the emission distribution is a multi-output Gaussian process with a CSM covariance kernel. Results are presented for measured
multi-region electrophysiological data.

Introduction

Gaussian process (GP) models have become an important component of the machine learning literature. They have provided a basis for non-linear multivariate regression and classification tasks, and
have enjoyed much success in a wide variety of applications [16].
A GP places a prior distribution over latent functions, rather than model parameters. In the sense
that these functions are defined for any number of sample points and sample positions, as well
as any general functional form, GPs are nonparametric. The properties of the latent functions are
defined by a positive definite covariance kernel that controls the covariance between the function
at any two sample points. Recently, the spectral mixture (SM) kernel was proposed by Wilson and
Adams [24] to model a spectral density with a scale-location mixture of Gaussians. This flexible
and interpretable class of kernels is capable of recovering any composition of stationary kernels
[27, 9, 13]. The SM kernel has been used for GP regression of a scalar output (i.e., single function, or
observation “task”), achieving impressive results in extrapolating atmospheric CO2 concentrations
[24]; image inpainting [25]; and feature extraction from electrophysiological signals [21].
However, the SM kernel is not defined for multiple outputs (multiple correlated functions). Multioutput GPs intersect with the field of multi-task learning [4], where solving similar problems jointly
allows for the transfer of statistical strength between problems, improving learning performance
when compared to learning all tasks individually. In this paper, we consider neuroscience applications where low-frequency (< 200 Hz) extracellular potentials are simultaneously recorded from
implanted electrodes in multiple brain regions of a mouse [6]. These signals are known as local field
potentials (LFPs) and are often highly correlated between channels. Inferring and understanding
that interdependence is biologically significant.

A multi-output GP can be thought of as a standard GP (all observations are jointly normal) where the
covariance kernel is a function of both the input space and the output space (see [2] and references
therein for a comprehensive review); here “input space” means the points at which the functions are
sampled (e.g., time), and the “output space” may correspond to different brain regions. A particular
positive definite form of this multi-output covariance kernel is the sum of separable (SoS) kernels,
or the linear model of coregionalization (LMC) in the geostatistics literature [10], where a separable
kernel is represented by the product of separate kernels for the input and output spaces.
While extending the SM kernel to the multi-output setting via the LMC framework (i.e., the SMLMC kernel) provides a powerful modeling framework, the SM-LMC kernel does not intuitively
represent the data. Specifically, the SM-LMC kernel encodes the cross-amplitude spectrum (square
root of the cross power spectral density) between every pair of channels, but provides no crossphase information. Together, the cross-amplitude and cross-phase spectra form the cross-spectrum,
defined as the Fourier transform of the cross-covariance between the pair of channels.
Motivated by the desire to encode the full cross-spectra into the covariance kernel, we design a novel
kernel termed the cross-spectral mixture (CSM) kernel, which provides an intuitive representation
of the power and phase dependencies between multiple outputs. The need for embedding the full
cross-spectrum into the covariance kernel is illustrated by a recent surge in neuroscience research
discovering that LFP interdependencies between regions exhibit phase synchrony patterns that are
dependent on frequency band [11, 17, 18].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a summary of GP regression
models for vector-valued data, and Section 3 introduces the SM, SM-LMC, and novel CSM covariance kernels. In Section 4, the CSM kernel is incorporated in a Bayesian hidden Markov model
(HMM) [14] with a GP emission distribution as a demonstration of its utility in hierarchical modeling. Section 5 provides details on inverting the Bayesian HMM with variational inference, as well
as details on a fast, novel GP fitting process that approximates the CSM kernel by its representation
in the spectral domain. Section 6 analyzes the performance of this approximation and presents results for the CSM kernel in the neuroscience application, considering measured multi-region LFP
data from the brain of a mouse. We conclude in Section 7 by discussing how this novel kernel can
trivially be extended to any time-series application where GPs and the cross-spectrum are of interest.

Review of Multi-Output Gaussian Process Regression

A multi-output regression task estimates samples from C output channels, y n = [yn1 , . . . , ynC ]T
corresponding to the n-th input point xn (e.g., the n-th temporal sample). An unobserved latent
function f (x) = [f1 (x), . . . , fC (x)]T is responsible for generating the observations, such that y n ∼
N (f (xn ), H −1 ), where H = diag(η1 , . . . , ηC ) is the precision of additive Gaussian noise.
A GP prior on the latent function is formalized by f (x) ∼ GP(m(x), K(x, x0 )) for arbitrary
input x, where the mean function m(x) ∈ RC is set to equal 0 without loss of generality, and
0
the covariance function (K(x, x0 ))c,c0 = k c,c (x, x0 ) = cov(fc (x), fc0 (x0 )) creates dependencies
0
between observations at input points x and x , as observed on channels c and c0 . In general, the input
space x could be vector valued, but for simplicity we here assume it to be scalar, consistent with our
motivating neuroscience application in which x corresponds to time.
A convenient representation for multi-output kernel functions is to separate the kernel into the product of a kernel for the input space and a kernel for the interactions between the outputs. This is
known as a separable kernel. A sum of separable kernels (SoS) representation [2] is given by

where kq (x, x0 ) is the input space kernel for component q, bq (c, c0 ) is the q-th output interaction
kernel, and B q ∈ RC×C is a positive semi-definite output kernel matrix. Note that we have a discrete set of C output spaces, c ∈ {1, . . . , C}, where the input space x is continuous, and discretely
sampled arbitrarily in experiments. The SoS formulation is also known as the linear model of coregionalization (LMC) [10] and B q is termed the coregionalization matrix. When Q = 1, the LMC
reduces to the intrinsic coregionalization model (ICM) [2], and when rank(B q ) is restricted to equal
1, the LMC reduces to the semiparametric latent factor model (SLFM) [19].

elements belonging to channel C. Since both the likelihood p(y|f , x) and distribution over latent

Each input-space covariance kernel is defined by a set of hyperparameters, θ. This conditioning was

the squared exponential kernel is used, then kSE (x, x0 ; θ) = exp(− 12 ||x − x0 ||2 /`2 ), defined by a
single hyperparameter θ = {`}. To fit a GP to the dataset, the hyperparameters are typically chosen
to maximize the marginal likelihood in (3) via gradient ascent.

Expressive Kernels in the Spectral Domain

This section first introduces the spectral mixture (SM) kernel [24] as well as a multi-output extension
of the SM kernel within the LMC framework. While the SM-LMC model is capable of representing complex spectral relationships between channels, it does not intuitively model the cross-phase
spectrum between channels. We propose a novel kernel known as the cross-spectral mixture (CSM)
kernel that provides both the cross-amplitude and cross-phase spectra of multi-channel observations.
Detailed derivations of each of these kernels is found in the Supplemental Material.
3.1

The Spectral Mixture Kernel

A spectral Gaussian (SG) kernel is defined by an amplitude spectrum with a single Gaussian distribution reflected about the origin,
1
SSG (ω; θ) = [N (ω; −µ, ν) + N (ω; µ, ν)] ,
(4)
2
where θ = {µ, ν} are the kernel hyperparameters, µ represents the peak frequency, and the variance
ν is a scale parameter that controls the spread of the spectrum around µ. This spectrum is a function
of angular frequency. The Fourier transform of (4) results in the stationary, positive definite autocovariance function
1
kSG (τ ; θ) = exp(− ντ 2 ) cos(µτ ),
(5)
2
0
where stationarity implies dependence on input domain differences k(τ ; θ) = k(x,
√ x ; θ) with τ =
0
x − x . The SG kernel may also be derived by considering a latent signal f (x) = 2 cos(ω(x + φ))
with frequency uncertainty ω ∼ N (µ, ν) and phase offset ωφ. The kernel is the auto-covariance
function for f (x), such that kSG (τ ; θ) = cov(f (x), f (x+τ )). When computing the auto-covariance,
the frequency ω is marginalized out, providing the kernel in (5) that includes all frequencies in the
spectral domain with probability 1.
A weighted, linear combination of SG kernels gives the spectral mixture (SM) kernel [24],
kSM (τ ; θ) =

where θ q = {aq , νq , µq } and θ = {θ q } has 3Q degrees of freedom. The SM kernel may be derived
as the Fourier transform of the spectral density SSM (ω; θ) or as the auto-covariance of latent funcPQ p
tions f (x) = q=1 2aq cos(ωq (x + φq )) with uncertainty in angular frequency ωq ∼ N (µq , νq ).

and rank-1 SM-LMC kernel (center). The functions are comprised of two SG components centered at 4 and 5
Hz. For the CSM kernel, we set the phase shift ψc0 ,2 = π. Right: the cross-amplitude (purple) and cross-phase
(green) spectra between f1 (x) and f2 (x) are shown for the CSM kernel (solid) and SM-LMC kernel (dashed).
The ability to tune phase relationships is beneficial for kernel design and interpretation.

The moniker for the SM kernel in (6) reflects the mixture of Gaussian components that define the
spectral density of the kernel. The SM kernel is able to represent any stationary covariance kernel
given large enough Q; to name a few, this includes any combination of squared exponential, Matèrn,
rational quadratic, or periodic kernels [9, 16, 24].
3.2

The Cross-Spectral Mixture Kernel

A multi-output version of the SM kernel uses the SG kernel directly within the LMC framework:
Q
X
K SM-LMC (τ ; θ) =
B q kSG (τ ; θ q ),
(7)
q=1

where Q SG kernels are shared among the outputs via the coregionalization matrices {B q }Q
q=1 . A
generalized, non-stationary version of this SM-LMC kernel was proposed in [23] using the Gaussian
process regression network (GPRN) [26]. The marginal distribution for any single channel is simply
a Gaussian process with a SM covariance kernel. While this formulation is capable of providing
a full cross-amplitude spectrum between two channels, it contains no information
about a crossP
phase spectrum. Specifically, each channel is merely a weighted sum of q Rq latent functions
where Rq = rank(B q ). Whereas these functions are shared exactly across channels, our novel CSM
kernel shares phase-shifted versions of these latent functions across channels.

Both the CSM and SM-LMC kernels force the marginal distribution of data from a single channel to be a Gaussian process with a SM covariance kernel. The CSM kernel is derived in the
Supplemental Material by considering functions represented by phase-shifted sinusoidal signals,

A comparison between draws from Gaussian processes with CSM and SM-LMC kernels is shown

marginal amplitude spectra for shared {µq , νq , aq }, their cross-amplitude spectra differ due to the
inherent destructive interference of the CSM kernel (see Figure 1, right).

Multi-Channel HMM Analysis

Neuroscientists are interested in examining how the network structure of the brain changes as animals undergo a task, or various levels of arousal [15]. The LFP signal is a modality that allows
researchers to explore this network structure. In the model provided in this section, we cluster segments of the LFP signal into discrete “brain states” [21]. Each brain state is represented by a unique
cross-spectrum provided by the CSM kernel. The use of the full cross-spectrum to define brain states
is supported by previous work discovering that 1) the power spectral density of LFP signals indicate
various levels of arousal states in mice [7, 21], and 2) frequency-dependent phase synchrony patterns
change as animals undergo different conditions in a task [11, 17, 18] (see Figure 2).
The vector-valued observations from C channels are segmented into W contiguous, non-overlapping
windows. The windows are common across channels, such that the C-channel data for window
w
w T
w
w ∈ {1, . . . , W } are represented by y w
n = [yn1 , . . . , ynC ] at sample location xn . Given data, each
window consists of Nw temporal samples, but the model is defined for any set of sample locations.
We model the observations {y w
n } as emissions from a hidden Markov model (HMM) with L hidden,
discrete states. State assignments are represented by latent variables ζw ∈ {1, . . . , L} for each window w ∈ {1, . . . , W }. In general, L is a set upper bound of the number of states (brain states [21],
or “clusters”), but the model can shrink down and infer the number of states needed to fit the data.
This is achieved by defining the dynamics of the latent states according to a Bayesian HMM [14]:
ζ1 ∼ Categorical(ρ0 ),

ζw ∼ Categorical(ρζw−1 ) ∀w ≥ 2,

ρ0 , ρ` ∼ Dirichlet(ν),

where the initial state assignment is drawn from a categorical distribution with probability vector ρ0
and all subsequent states assignments are drawn from the transition vector ρζw−1 . Here, ρ`h is the
probability of transitioning from state ` to state h. The vectors {ρ0 , ρ1 , . . . , ρL } are independently
drawn from symmetric Dirichlet distributions centered around ν = [1/L, . . . , 1/L] to impose sparsity on transition probabilities. In effect, this allows the model to learn the number of states needed
for the data (i.e., fewer than L) [3].
Each cluster ` ∈ {1, . . . , L} is assigned GP parameters θ ` . The latent cluster assignment ζw for
window w indicates which set of GP parameters control the emission distribution of the HMM:
−1

n ∼ N (f w (xn ), H ζw ),

where (K(x, x0 ; θ ` ))c,c0 = kCSM
(x, x0 ; θ ` ) is the CSM kernel, and the cluster-dependent precision
H ζw = diag(η ζw ) generates independent Gaussian observation noise. In this way, each window w
is modeled as a stochastic process with a multi-channel cross-spectrum defined by θ ζw .

are consistently present in the cross-phase spectrum, motivating the CSM kernel. This frequency dependency
aligns with preconcieved notions of bands, or brain waves (e.g., 8-12 Hz alpha waves).

A convenient notation vectorizes all observations within a window, y w = vec([y w
1 , . . . , y Nw ] ),
w
where vec(A) is the vectorization of matrix A; i.e., the first Nw elements of y are observations
from channel 1, up to the last Nw elements of y w belonging to channel C. Because samples are
obtained on an evenly spaced temporal grid, we fix Nw = N and align relative sample locations
within a window to an oracle xw = x = [x1 , . . . , xN ]T for all w.

this gradient requires the inversion of Γ` , which has complexity O(N 3 C 3 ) and storage requirements
O(N 2 C 2 ) since a simple method to invert a sum of Kronecker products does not exist.
A common trick for GPs with evenly spaced samples (e.g., a temporal grid) is to use the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) to approximate the inverse of Γ` by viewing this as an approximately
circulant matrix [5, 12]. These methods can speed up inference because circulant matrices are diagonalizable by the DFT coefficient matrix. Adjusting these methods to the multi-output formulation,
we show how the DFT of the marginal covariance matrices retains the cross-spectrum information.
Proposition 5.1. Let y w ∼ N (0, Γζw ) represent the marginal likelihood of circularly-symmetric
[8] real-valued observations in window w, and denote the concatenation of the DFT of each channel
as z w = (I C ⊗ U )† y w where U is the N × N unitary DFT matrix. Then, z w is shown in the

process is that, with the latter, derivatives of the covariance kernel are used, while, with the former, derivatives of the power spectral density are used. Computationally, this method improves the
naı̈ve O(N 3 C 3 ) complexity of fitting the standard CSM kernel to O(N C 3 ) complexity. Memory
requirements are also reduced from O(N 2 C 2 ) to O(N C 2 ). The reason for this improvement is that
S ` is now represented as N independent C × C blocks, reducing the inversion of S ` to inverting a

Performance and Inference Analysis

The performance of the CSM kernel is compared to the SM-LMC kernel and SE-LMC (squared
exponential) kernel. Each of these models allow Q=20, and the rank of the coregionalization matrices is varied from rank-1 to rank-3. For a given rank, the CSM kernel always obtains the largest
marginal likelihood for a window of LFP data, and the marginal likelihood always increases for
increasing rank. To penalize the number of kernel parameters (e.g., a rank-3, Q=20 CSM kernel for
7 channels has 827 free parameters to optimize), the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used for
model selection [1]. For this reason, we do not test rank greater than 3. Table 1 shows that a rank-2
CSM kernel is selected using this criterion, followed by a rank-1 CSM kernel. To show the rank-2
CSM kernel is consistently selected as the preferred model we report means and standard deviations
of AIC value differences across 30 different randomly selected 3-second windows of LFP data.
Next, we provide numerical results for the conditions required when using the DFT approximation
in (10). This allows for one to define details of a particular application in order to determine if the
DFT approximation to the CSM kernel is appropriate. A CSM kernel is defined for two outputs
with a single Gaussian component, Q = 1. The mean frequency and variance for this component
are set to push the limits of the application. For example, with LFP data, low frequency content is
of interest, namely greater than 1 Hz; therefore, we test values of µ
e1 ∈ { 12 , 1, 3} Hz. We anticipate
2
variances at these frequencies to be around νe1 = 1 Hz . A conversion to angular frequency gives

shows that the DFT approximation struggles to resolve low frequency components unless the series length is sufficiently long. Due to the approximation error, when using the DFT approximation
on LFP data we a priori filter out frequencies below 1.5 Hz and perform analyses with a series
length of 3 seconds. This ensures the DFT approximation represents the true covariance matrix. The
following application of the CSM kernel uses these settings.

Including the CSM Kernel in a Bayesian Hierarchical Model

We analyze 12 hours of LFP data of a mouse transitioning between different stages of sleep [7, 21].
Observations were recorded simultaneously from 4 channels [6], high-pass filtered at 1.5 Hz, and
subsampled to 200 Hz. Using 3 second windows provides N = 600 and W = 14, 400. The HMM
was implemented with the number of kernel components Q = 15 and the number of states L = 7.

Figure 4: A subset of results from the Bayesian HMM analysis of brain states. In the upper left, the full crossspectrum for an arbitrary state (state 7) is plotted. In the upper right, the amplitude (top) and phase (bottom)
functions for the cross-spectrum between the Dorsomedial Striatum (DMS) and Hippocampus (DHipp) are
shown for all seven states. On the bottom, the maximum likelihood state assignments are shown and compared
to the state assignments from [7]. The same colors between the CSM state assignments and the phase and
amplitude functions correspond to the same state. These colors are alligned to the [7] states, but there is no
explicit relationship between the colors of the two state sequences.

This was chosen because sleep staging tasks categorize as many as seven states: various levels of
rapid eye movement, slow wave sleep, and wake [20]. Although rigorous model selection on L
is necessary to draw scientific conclusions from the results, the purpose of this experiment is to
illustrate the utility of the CSM kernel in this application.
An illustrative subset of the results are shown in Figure 4. The full cross-spectrum is shown for
a single state (state 7), and the cross-spectrum between the Dorsomedial Striatum and the Dorsal
Hippocampus are shown for all states. Furthermore, we show the progression of these brain state
assignments over 3 hours and compare them to states from the method of [7], where statistics of the
Hippocampus spectral density were clustered in an ad hoc fashion. To the best of our knowledge,
this method represents the most relevant and accurate results for sleep staging from LFP signals in
the neuroscience literature. From these results, it is apparent that our clusters pick up sub-states of
[7]. For instance, states 3, 6, and 7 all appear with high probability when the method from [7] infers
state 3. Observing the cross-phase function of sub-state 7 reveals striking differences from other
states in the theta wave (4-7 Hz) and the alpha wave (8-15 Hz). This cross-phase function is nearly
identical for states 2 and 5, implying that significant differences in the cross-amplitude spectrum
may have played a role in identifying the difference between these two brain states.
Many more of these interesting details exist due to the expressive nature of the CSM kernel. As a
full interpretation of the cross-spectrum results is not the focus of this work, we contend that the
CSM kernel has the potential to have a tremendous impact in fields such as neuroscience, where the
dynamics of cross-spectrum relationships of LFP signals are of great interest.

Conclusion

This work introduces the cross-spectral mixture kernel as an expressive kernel capable of extracting
patterns for multi-channel observations. Combined with the powerful nonparametric representation
of a Gaussian process, the CSM kernel expresses a functional form for every pairwise cross-spectrum
between channels. This is a novel approach that merges Gaussian processes in the machine learning
community to standard signal processing techniques. We believe the CSM kernel has the potential
to impact a broad array of disciplines since the kernel can trivially be extended to any time-series
application where Gaussian processes and the cross-spectrum are of interest.
