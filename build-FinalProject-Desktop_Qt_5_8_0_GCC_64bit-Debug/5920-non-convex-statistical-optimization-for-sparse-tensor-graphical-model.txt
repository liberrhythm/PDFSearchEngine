Abstract
We consider the estimation of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation
of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the
data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product
structure. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves
minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this
estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which
iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains
an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent
graph recovery. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with
only one tensor sample, which is unobserved in previous work. Our theoretical
results are backed by thorough numerical studies.

Introduction

High-dimensional tensor-valued data are prevalent in many fields such as personalized recommendation systems and brain imaging research [1, 2]. Traditional recommendation systems are mainly
based on the user-item matrix, whose entry denotes each user’s preference for a particular item. To
incorporate additional information into the analysis, such as the temporal behavior of users, we need
to consider a user-item-time tensor. For another example, functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data can be viewed as a three way (third-order) tensor since it contains the brain measurements
taken on different locations over time for various experimental conditions. Also, in the example of
microarray study for aging [3], thousands of gene expression measurements are recorded on 16 tissue
types on 40 mice with varying ages, which forms a four way gene-tissue-mouse-age tensor.
In this paper, we study the estimation of conditional independence structure within tensor data. For
example, in the microarray study for aging we are interested in the dependency structure across different genes, tissues, ages and even mice. Assuming data are drawn from a tensor normal distribution,
a straightforward way to estimate this structure is to vectorize the tensor and estimate the underlying
Gaussian graphical model associated with the vector. Such an approach ignores the tensor structure
1

and requires estimating a rather high dimensional precision matrix with insufficient sample size. For
instance, in the aforementioned fMRI application the sample size is one if we aim to estimate the
dependency structure across different locations, time and experimental conditions. To address such a
problem, a popular approach is to assume the covariance matrix of the tensor normal distribution is
separable in the sense that it is the Kronecker product of small covariance matrices, each of which
corresponds to one way of the tensor. Under this assumption, our goal is to estimate the precision
matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor. See §1.1 for a detailed survey of previous work.

Despite the fact that the assumption of the Kronecker product structure of covariance makes the
statistical model much more parsimonious, it poses significant challenges. In particular, the penalized
negative log-likelihood function is non-convex with respect to the unknown sparse precision matrices.
Consequently, there exists a gap between computational and statistical theory. More specifically,
as we will show in §1.1, existing literature mostly focuses on establishing the existence of a local
optimum that has desired statistical guarantees, rather than offering efficient algorithmic procedures
that provably achieve the desired local optima. In contrast, we analyze an alternating minimization algorithm which iteratively minimizes the non-convex objective function with respect to each
individual precision matrix while fixing the others. The established theoretical guarantees of the
proposed algorithm are as follows. Suppose that we have n observations from a K-th order tensor
normal distribution. We denote by mk , sk , dk (k = 1, . . . , K) the dimension, sparsity, and max
number of non-zero entries in each row of the precision matrix corresponding to the k-th way of the
QK
tensor. Besides, we define m = k=1
p mk . The k-th precision matrix estimator from our alternating
minimization algorithm achieves a mk (mk + sk ) log mk /(nm) statistical rate of convergence in
Frobenius norm, which is minimax-optimal since this is the best rate one can obtain even when the
rest K 1 true precision
pmatrices are known [4]. Furthermore, under an extra irrepresentability
condition,pwe establish a mk log mk /(nm) rate of convergence in max norm, which is also optimal,
and a dk mk log mk /(nm) rate of convergence in spectral norm. These estimation consistency
results and a sufficiently large signal strength condition further imply the model selection consistency
of recovering all the edges. A notable implication of these results is that, when K 3, our alternating
minimization algorithm can achieve estimation consistency in Frobenius norm even if we only have
access to one tensor sample, which is often the case in practice. This phenomenon is unobserved in
previous work. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the numerical performance of
the proposed alternating minimization method. Under the guidance of theory, we propose a way to
significantly accelerate the algorithm without sacrificing the statistical accuracy.

Related work and our contribution

A special case of our sparse tensor graphical model when K = 2 is the sparse matrix graphical
model, which is studied by [5–8]. In particular, [5] and [6] only establish the existence of a local
optima with desired statistical guarantees. Meanwhile, [7] considers an algorithm that is similar to
ours. However, the statistical rates of convergence obtained by [6, 7] are much slower than ours
when K = 2. See Remark 3.6 in §3.1 for a detailed comparison. For K = 2, our statistical rate of
convergence in Frobenius norm recovers the result of [5]. In other words, our theory confirms that the
desired local optimum studied by [5] not only exists, but is also attainable by an efficient algorithm. In
addition, for matrix graphical model, [8] establishes the statistical rates of convergence in spectral and
Frobenius norms for the estimator attained by a similar algorithm. Their results achieve estimation
consistency in spectral norm with only one matrix observation. However, their rate is slower than
ours with K = 2. See Remark 3.11 in §3.2 for a detailed discussion. Furthermore, we allow K to
increase and establish estimation consistency even in Frobenius norm for n = 1. Most importantly,
all these results focus on matrix graphical model and can not handle the aforementioned motivating
applications such as the gene-tissue-mouse-age tensor dataset.
In the context of sparse tensor graphical model with a general K, [9] shows the existence of a
local optimum with desired rates, but does not prove whether there exists an efficient algorithm
that provably attains such a local optimum. In contrast, we prove that our alternating minimization
algorithm achieves an estimator with desired statistical rates. To achieve it, we apply a novel theoretical
framework to separately consider the population and sample optimizers, and then establish the onestep convergence for the population optimizer (Theorem 3.1) and the optimal rate of convergence
for the sample optimizer (Theorem 3.4). A new concentration result (Lemma B.1) is developed for
this purpose, which is also of independent interest. Moreover, we establish additional theoretical
2

guarantees including the optimal rate of convergence in max norm, the estimation consistency in
spectral norm, and the graph recovery consistency of the proposed sparse precision matrix estimator.
In addition to the literature on graphical models, our work is also closely related to a recent line of
research on alternating minimization for non-convex optimization problems [10–13]. These existing
results mostly focus on problems such as dictionary learning, phase retrieval and matrix decomposition.
Hence, our statistical model and analysis are completely different from theirs. Also, our paper is
related to a recent line of work on tensor decomposition. See, e.g., [14–17] and the references therein.
Compared with them, our work focuses on the graphical model structure within tensor-valued data.
Notation: For a matrix A = (Ai,j ) 2 Rd⇥d , we denoteP
kAk1 , kAk2 , kAkF as its max, spectral,
and Frobenius norm, respectively. We define kAk1,off := i6=j |Ai,j | as its off-diagonal `1 norm and
P
|||A|||1 := maxi j |Ai,j | as the maximum absolute row sum. Denote vec(A) as the vectorization
of A which stacks the columns of A. Let tr(A) be the trace of A. For an index set S = {(i, j), i, j 2
{1, . . . , d}}, we define [A]S as the matrix whose entry indexed by (i, j) 2 S is equal to Ai,j , and
zero otherwise. We denote 1d as the identity matrix with dimension d ⇥ d. Throughout this paper, we
use C, C1 , C2 , . . . to denote generic absolute constants, whose values may vary from line to line.

Sparse tensor graphical model
Preliminary

We employ the tensor notations used by [18]. Throughout this paper, higher order tensors are denoted
by boldface Euler script letters, e.g. T . We consider a K-th order tensor T 2 Rm1 ⇥m2 ⇥···⇥mK .
When K = 1 it reduces to a vector and when K = 2 it reduces to a matrix. The (i1 , . . . , iK )-th
element of the tensor T is denoted to be Ti1 ,...,iK . Meanwhile, we define the vectorization
Q of T
as vec(T ) := (T1,1,...,1 , . . . , Tm1 ,1,...,1 , . . . , T1,m2 ,...,mK , Tm1 ,m2 ,...,mK )> 2 Rm with m = k mk .
P

In addition, we define the Frobenius norm of a tensor T as kT kF :=
.
i1 ,...,iK Ti1 ,...,iK
For tensors, a fiber refers to the higher order analogue of the row and column of matrices. A fiber is
obtained by fixing all but one of the indices of the tensor, e.g., the mode-k fiber of T(k) is given by
Ti1 ,...,,ik 1 ,:,ik+1 ,...,iK . Matricization, also known as unfolding, is the process to transform a tensor
into a matrix. We denote T(k) as the mode-k matricization of a tensor T , which arranges the mode-k
fibers to be the columns of the resulting matrix. Another useful operation in tensors is the k-mode
product. The k-mode product of a tensor T 2 Rm1 ⇥m2 ⇥···⇥mK with a matrix A 2 RJ⇥mk is denoted
as T ⇥k A and is of the sizeP
m1 ⇥ · · · ⇥ mk 1 ⇥ J ⇥ mk+1 ⇥ · · · ⇥ mK . Its entry is defined as (T ⇥k
m
A)i1 ,...,ik 1 ,j,ik+1 ,...,iK := ik k=1 Ti1 ,...,iK Aj,ik . In addition, for a list of matrices {A1 , . . . , AK }
mk ⇥mk
with Ak 2 R
, k = 1, . . . , K, we define T ⇥ {A1 , . . . , AK } := T ⇥1 A1 ⇥2 · · · ⇥K AK .
2.2

Model

A tensor T 2 Rm1 ⇥m2 ⇥···⇥mK follows the tensor normal distribution with zero mean and covariance
matrices ⌃1 , . . . , ⌃K , denoted as T ⇠ TN(0; ⌃1 , . . . , ⌃K ), if its probability density function is

where m = k=1 mk and ⌃ 1/2 := {⌃1 , . . . , ⌃K }. When K = 1, this tensor normal
distribution reduces to the vector normal distribution with zero mean and covariance ⌃1 . According
to [9, 18], it can be shown that T ⇠ TN(0; ⌃1 , . . . , ⌃K ) if and only if vec(T ) ⇠ N(vec(0); ⌃K ⌦
· · · ⌦ ⌃1 ), where vec(0) 2 Rm and ⌦ is the matrix Kronecker product.

We consider the parameter estimation for the tensor normal model. Assume that we observe independently and identically distributed tensor samples T1 , . . . , Tn from TN(0; ⌃⇤1 , . . . , ⌃⇤K ). We
aim to estimate the true covariance matrices (⌃⇤1 , . . . , ⌃⇤K ) and their corresponding true precision
matrices (⌦⇤1 , . . . , ⌦⇤K ) where ⌦⇤k = ⌃⇤k 1 (k = 1, . . . , K). To address the identifiability issue in
the parameterization of the tensor normal distribution, we assume that k⌦⇤k kF = 1 for k = 1, . . . , K.
This renormalization assumption does not change the graph structure of the original precision matrix.

A standard approach to estimate ⌦⇤k , k = 1, . . . , K, is to use the maximum likelihood method
via (2.1). Up to a constant, the negative log-likelihood function of the tensor normal distribution

is tr[S(⌦K ⌦ · · · ⌦ ⌦1 )]
k=1 (m/mk ) log |⌦k |, where S := n
i=1 vec(Ti )vec(Ti ) . To
encourage the sparsity of each precision matrix in the high-dimensional scenario, we consider a
penalized log-likelihood estimator, which is obtained by minimizing

where P k (·) is a penalty function indexed by the tuning parameter k . In this paper, we focus on
the lasso penalty [19], i.e., P k (⌦k ) = k k⌦k k1,off . This estimation procedure applies similarly to a
broad family of other penalty functions.
We name the penalized model from (2.2) as the sparse tensor graphical model. It reduces to the sparse
vector graphical model [20, 21] when K = 1, and the sparse matrix graphical model [5–8] when
K = 2. Our framework generalizes them to fulfill the demand of capturing the graphical structure of
higher order tensor-valued data.
2.3

Estimation

This section introduces the estimation procedure for the sparse tensor graphical model. A computationally efficient algorithm is provided to estimate the precision matrix for each way of the
tensor.
Recall that in (2.2), qn (⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ) is jointly non-convex with respect to ⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K . Nevertheless,
qn (⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ) is a bi-convex problem since qn (⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ) is convex in ⌦k when the rest K 1
precision matrices are fixed. The bi-convex property plays a critical role in our algorithm construction
and its theoretical analysis in §3.

According to its bi-convex property, we propose to solve this non-convex problem by alternatively
update one precision matrix with other matrices fixed. Note that, for any k = 1, . . . , K, minimizing
(2.2) with respect to ⌦k while fixing the rest K 1 precision matrices is equivalent to minimizing

The details of our Tensor lasso (Tlasso) algorithm are shown in Algorithm 1. It starts with a random
initialization and then alternatively updates each precision matrix until it converges. In §3, we will
illustrate that the statistical properties of the obtained estimator are insensitive to the choice of the
initialization (see the discussion following Theorem 3.5).

Theory of statistical optimization

We first prove the estimation errors in Frobenius norm, max norm, and spectral norm, and then provide
the model selection consistency of our Tlasso estimator. We defer all the proofs to the appendix.
3.1

Based on the penalized log-likelihood in (2.2), we define the population log-likelihood function as
q(⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ) :=

By minimizing q(⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ) with respect to ⌦k , k = 1, . . . , K, we obtain the population minimization function with the parameter ⌦[K] k := {⌦1 , . . . , ⌦k 1 , ⌦k+1 , . . . , ⌦K }, i.e.,
Mk (⌦[K]

k)

:= argmin q(⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ).

⌦k

Theorem 3.1. For any k = 1, . . . , K, if ⌦j (j 6= k) satisfies tr(⌃⇤j ⌦j ) 6= 0, then the population
⇥
⇤ 1
Q
minimization function in (3.2) satisfies Mk (⌦[K] k ) = m mk j6=k tr(⌃⇤j ⌦j ) ⌦⇤k .

Theorem 3.1 shows a surprising phenomenon that the population minimization function recovers the
true precision matrix up to a constant in only one iteration. If ⌦j = ⌦⇤j , j 6= k, then Mk (⌦[K] k ) =
⌦⇤k . Otherwise, after a normalization such that kMk (⌦[K] k )kF = 1, the normalized population
minimization function still fully recovers ⌦⇤k . This observation suggests that setting T = 1 in
Algorithm 1 is sufficient. Such a suggestion will be further supported by our numeric results.
In practice, when (3.1) is unknown, we can approximate it via its sample version qn (⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K )
defined in (2.2), which gives rise to the statistical error in the estimation procedure. Analogously to
(3.2), we define the sample-based minimization function with parameter ⌦[K] k as
ck (⌦[K]
M

k)

:= argmin qn (⌦1 , . . . , ⌦K ).

(3.3)

⌦k

In order to prove the estimation error, it remains to quantify the statistical error induced from finite
samples. The following two regularity conditions are assumed for this purpose.
Condition 3.2 (Bounded Eigenvalues). For any k = 1, . . . , K, there is a constant C1 > 0 such that,
0 < C1  min (⌃⇤k )  max (⌃⇤k )  1/C1 < 1,
where min (⌃⇤k ) and max (⌃⇤k ) refer to the minimal and maximal eigenvalue of ⌃⇤k , respectively.
Condition 3.2 requires the uniform boundedness of the eigenvalues of true covariance matrices ⌃⇤k . It
has been commonly assumed in the graphical model literature [22].
Condition 3.3p
(Tuning). For any k = 1, . . . , Kpand some constant C2 > 0, the tuning parameter k
satisfies 1/C2 log mk /(nmmk )  k  C2 log mk /(nmmk ).
Condition 3.3 specifies the choice of the tuning parameters. In practice, a data-driven tuning procedure
[23] can be performed to approximate the optimal choice of the tuning parameters.

Before characterizing the statistical error, we define a sparsity parameter for ⌦⇤k , k = 1, . . . , K. Let
Sk := {(i, j) : [⌦⇤k ]i,j 6= 0}. Denote the sparsity parameter sk := |Sk | mk , which is the number
of nonzero entries in the off-diagonal component of ⌦⇤k . For each k = 1, . . . , K, we define B(⌦⇤k ) as
the set containing ⌦⇤k and its neighborhood for some sufficiently large constant radius ↵ > 0, i.e.,
B(⌦⇤k ) := {⌦ 2 Rmk ⇥mk : ⌦ = ⌦> ; ⌦ 0; k⌦ ⌦⇤k kF  ↵}.
(3.4)
Theorem 3.4. Assume Conditions 3.2 and 3.3 hold. For any k = 1, . . . , K, the statistical error of the
sample-based minimization function defined in (3.3) satisfies that, for any fixed ⌦j 2 B(⌦⇤j ) (j 6= k),

Theorem 3.4 establishes the statistical error associated with M
j
with j 6= k. In comparison, previous work on the existence of a local solution with desired statistical
property only establishes theorems similar to Theorem 3.4 for ⌦j = ⌦⇤j with j 6= k. The extension
to an arbitrary ⌦j 2 B(⌦⇤j ) involves non-trivial technical barriers. Particularly, we first establish the
rate of convergence of the difference between a sample-based quadratic form with its expectation
(Lemma B.1) via concentration of Lipschitz functions of Gaussian random variables [24]. This result
is also of independent interest. We then carefully characterize the rate of convergence of Sk defined
in (2.3) (Lemma B.2). Finally, we develop (3.5) using the results for vector-valued graphical models
developed by [25].
According to Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.4, we obtain the rate of convergence of the Tlasso estimator
in terms of Frobenius norm, which is our main result.
Theorem 3.5. Assume that Conditions 3.2 and 3.3 hold. For any k = 1, . . . , K, if the initialization

b k from Algorithm 1 with T = 1 satisfies,
satisfies ⌦j 2 B(⌦⇤j ) for any j 6= k, then the estimator ⌦

Theorem 3.5 suggests that as long as the initialization is within a constant distance to the truth, our
Tlasso algorithm attains a consistent estimator after only one iteration. This initialization condition
(0)
(0)
⌦j 2 B(⌦⇤j ) trivially holds since for any ⌦j that is positive definite and has unit Frobenius norm,
(0)

we have k⌦j
⌦⇤k kF  2 by noting that k⌦⇤k kF = 1 (k = 1, . . . , K) for the identifiability of the
tensor normal distribution. In literature, [9] shows that there exists a local minimizer of (2.2) whose
convergence rate can achieve (3.6). However, it is unknown if their algorithm can find such minimizer
since there could be many other local minimizers.

A notable implication of Theorem 3.5 is that, when K 3, the estimator from our Tlasso algorithm
can achieve estimation consistency even if we only have access to one observation, i.e., n = 1, which
is often the case in practice. To see it, suppose that K = 3 and n = 1. When the dimensions m1 , m2 ,
and m3 are of the same order of magnitude and sk = O(mk ) for k = 1, 2, 3, all the three error rates
corresponding to k = 1, 2, 3 in (3.6) converge to zero.
This result indicates that the estimation of the k-th precision matrix takes advantage of the information
from the j-th way (j 6= k) of the tensor data. Consider a simple case that K = 2 and one precision
matrix ⌦⇤1 = 1m1 is known. In this scenario the rows of the matrix data are independent and hence
the effective sample size for estimating ⌦⇤2 is in fact nm1 . The optimality
presult for the vector-valued
graphical model [4] implies that the optimal rate for estimating ⌦⇤2 is (m2 + s2 ) log m2 /(nm1 ),
which matches our result in (3.6). Therefore, the rate in (3.6) obtained by our Tlasso estimator is
minimax-optimal since it is the best rate one can obtain even when ⌦⇤j (j 6= k) are known. As far as
we know, this phenomenon has not been discovered by any previous work in tensor graphical model.
Remark 3.6. For K = 2, our tensor graphical model reduces to matrix graphical model with Krob
necker
p product covariance structure [5–8]. In this case, the rate
p of convergence of ⌦1 in (3.6) reduces
to (m1 + s1 ) log m

shows that there exists a local minimizer of the objective function whose estimation errors match ours.
However, it is unknown if their estimator can achieve such convergence rate. On the other hand, our
theorem confirms that our algorithm is able to find such estimator with optimal rate of convergence.
3.2

Estimation error in max norm and spectral norm

We next show the estimation error in max norm and spectral norm. Trivially, these estimation errors are
bounded by that in Frobenius norm shown in Theorem 3.5. To develop improved rates of convergence
in max and spectral norms, we need to impose stronger conditions on true parameters.

We first introduce some important notations. Denote dk as the maximum number of non-zeros in any
row of the true precision matrices ⌦⇤k , that is,
dk :=

Denote the Hessian matrix ⇤k := ⌦⇤k 1 ⌦ ⌦⇤k 1 2 Rmk ⇥mk , whose entry [ ⇤k ](i,j),(s,t) corresponds
to the second order partial derivative of the objective function with respect to [⌦k ]i,j and [⌦k ]s,t . We
define its sub-matrix indexed by the index set Sk as [ ⇤k ]Sk ,Sk = [⌦⇤k 1 ⌦ ⌦⇤k 1 ]Sk ,Sk , which is the
|Sk | ⇥ |Sk | matrix with rows and columns of ⇤k indexed by Sk and Sk , respectively. Moreover, we
define  ⇤k := ([ ⇤k ]Sk ,Sk ) 1 1 . In order to establish the rate of convergence in max norm, we
need to impose an irrepresentability condition on the Hessian matrix.
Condition 3.7 (Irrepresentability). For each k = 1, . . . , K, there exists some ↵k 2 (0, 1] such that

Condition 3.7 controls the influence of the non-connected terms in Sck on the connected edges in Sk .

Theorem 3.9 shows that our Tlasso estimator achieves the optimal rate of convergence in max norm
[4]. Here we consider the estimator obtained after two iterations since we require a new concentration
inequality (Lemma B.3) for the sample covariance matrix, which is built upon the estimator in
Theorem 3.5. A direct consequence from Theorem 3.9 is the estimation error in spectral norm.
Corollary 3.10. Suppose the conditions of Theorem 3.9 hold, for any k = 1, . . . , K, we have

Remark 3.11. Now we compare our obtained rate of convergence in spectral norm for K = 2 with
that established
in the sparse matrix graphical model literature. In particular, [8] establishes the rate
p
of OP
mk (sk _ 1) log(m1 _ m2 )/(nmk ) for k = 1, 2. Therefore, when d2k  (sk _ 1), which
holds for example in the bounded degree graphs, our obtained rate is faster. However, our faster rate
comes at the price of assuming the irrepresentability condition. Using recent advance in nonconvex
regularization [28], we can eliminate the irrepresentability condition. We leave this to future work.

Model selection consistency

Theorem 3.9 ensures that the estimated precision matrixpcorrectly excludes all non-informative edges
and includes all the true edges (i, j) with |[⌦⇤k ]i,j | > C mk log mk /(nm) for some constant C > 0.
Therefore, in order to achieve the model selection consistency, a sufficient condition is to assume that,
for each k = 1, . . . , K, the minimal signal ✓k := min(i,j)2supp(⌦⇤k ) [⌦⇤k ]i,j is not too small.

Theorem 3.12 indicates that our Tlasso estimator is able to correctly recover the graphical structure of
each way of the high-dimensional tensor data. To the best of our knowledge, these is the first model
selection consistency result in high dimensional tensor graphical model.

Simulations

We compare the proposed Tlasso estimator with two alternatives. The first one is the direct graphical lasso (Glasso) approach [21] which applies the glasso to the vectorized tensor data to estimate ⌦⇤1 ⌦ · · · ⌦ ⌦⇤K directly. The second alternative method is the iterative penalized maximum likelihood method (P-MLE) proposed by [9], whose termination condition is set to be

For simplicity, in our Tlasso algorithm we set the initialization of k-th precision matrix
p as 1mk for each
k = 1, . . . , K and the total iteration T = 1. The tuning parameter k is set as 20 log mk /(nmmk ).
For a fair comparison, the same tuning parameter is applied in the P-MLE method. In the direct
Glasso approach, its tuning parameter is chosen by cross-validation via huge package [29].

We consider two simulations with a third order tensor, i.e., K = 3. In Simulation 1, we construct a
triangle graph, while in Simulation 2, we construct a four nearest neighbor graph for each precision
matrix. An illustration of the generated graphs are shown in Figure 1. In each simulation, we consider
three scenarios, i.e., s1: n = 10 and (m1 , m2 , m3 ) = (10, 10, 10); s2: n = 50 and (m1 , m2 , m3 ) =
(10, 10, 10); s3: n = 10 and (m1 , m2 , m3 ) = (100, 5, 5). We repeat each example 100 times
and compute the averaged computational time, the averaged estimation error of the Kronecker

TNR := i,j 1(b

As shown in Figure 1, our Tlasso is dramatically faster than both alternative methods. In Scenario
s3, Tlasso takes about five seconds for each replicate, the P-MLE takes about 500 seconds while
the direct Glasso method takes more than one hour and is omitted in the plot. Tlasso algorithm is
not only computationally efficient but also enjoys superior estimation accuracy. In all examples, the
direct Glasso method has significantly larger errors than Tlasso due to ignoring the tensor graphical
structure. Tlasso outperforms P-MLE in Scenarios s1 and s2 and is comparable to it in Scenario s3.

Table 1 shows the variable selection performance. Our Tlasso identifies almost all edges in these six
examples, while the Glasso and P-MLE method miss several true edges. On the other hand, Tlasso
tends to include more non-connected edges than other methods.
