Abstract
We propose a simple method to learn linear causal cyclic models in the presence
of latent variables. The method relies on equilibrium data of the model recorded
under a specific kind of interventions (“shift interventions”). The location and
strength of these interventions do not have to be known and can be estimated from
the data. Our method, called BACK S HIFT, only uses second moments of the data
and performs simple joint matrix diagonalization, applied to differences between
covariance matrices. We give a sufficient and necessary condition for identifiability of the system, which is fulfilled almost surely under some quite general
assumptions if and only if there are at least three distinct experimental settings,
one of which can be pure observational data. We demonstrate the performance on
some simulated data and applications in flow cytometry and financial time series.

Introduction

Discovering causal effects is a fundamentally important yet very challenging task in various disciplines, from public health research and sociological studies, economics to many applications in the
life sciences. There has been much progress on learning acyclic graphs in the context of structural
equation models [1], including methods that learn from observational data alone under a faithfulness assumption [2, 3, 4, 5], exploiting non-Gaussianity of the data [6, 7] or non-linearities [8].
Feedbacks are prevalent in most applications, and we are interested in the setting of [9], where we
observe the equilibrium data of a model that is characterized by a set of linear relations
x = Bx + e,

(1)

where x 2 R is a random vector and B 2 R
is the connectivity matrix with zeros on the diagonal (no self-loops). Allowing for self-loops would lead to an identifiability problem, independent
of the method. See Section B in the Appendix for more details on this setting. The graph corresponding to B has p nodes and an edge from node j to node i if and only if Bi,j 6= 0. The error
terms e are p-dimensional random variables with mean 0 and positive semi-definite covariance matrix ⌃e = E(eeT ). We do not assume that ⌃e is a diagonal matrix which allows the existence of
latent variables.

The solutions to (1) can be thought of as the deterministic equilibrium solutions (conditional on the
noise term) of a dynamic model governed by first-order difference equations with matrix B in the

sense of [10]. For well-defined equilibrium solutions of (1), we need that I B is invertible. Usually
we also want (1) to converge to an equilibrium when iterating as x(new)
Bx(old) + e or in other
words limm!1 Bm ⌘ 0. This condition is equivalent to the spectral radius of B being strictly
smaller than one [11]. We will make an assumption on cyclic graphs that restricts the strength of the
feedback. Specifically, let a cycle of length ⌘ be given by (m1 , . . . , m⌘+1 = m1 ) 2 {1, . . . , p}1+⌘
and mk 6= m` for 1  k < `  ⌘. We define the cycle-product CP (B) of a matrix B to be the
maximum over cycles of all lengths 1 < ⌘  p of the path-products
Y
CP (B) :=
max
Bmk+1 ,mk .
(2)
(m1 ,...,m⌘ ,m⌘+1 ) cycle
1k⌘
1<⌘p

The cycle-product CP (B) is clearly zero for acyclic graphs. We will assume the cycle-product to be
strictly smaller than one for identifiability results, see Assumption (A) below. The most interesting
graphs are those for which CP (B) < 1 and for which the spectral radius of B is strictly smaller than
one. Note that these two conditions are identical as long as the cycles in the graph do not intersect,
i.e., there is no node that is part of two cycles (for example if there is at most one cycle in the graph).
If cycles do intersect, we can have models for which either (i) CP (B) < 1 but the spectral radius
is larger than one or (ii) CP (B) > 1 but the spectral radius is strictly smaller than one. Models in
situation (ii) are not stable in the sense that the iterations will not converge under interventions. We
can for example block all but one cycle. If this one single unblocked cycle has a cycle-product larger
than 1 (and there is such a cycle in the graph if CP (B) > 1), then the solutions of the iteration are
not stable1 . Models in situation (i) are not stable either, even in the absence of interventions. We
can still in theory obtain the now instable equilibrium solutions to (1) as (I B) 1 e and the theory
below applies to these instable equilibrium solutions. However, such instable equilibrium solutions
are arguably of little practical interest. In summary: all interesting feedback models that are stable
under interventions satisfy both CP (B) < 1 and have a spectral radius strictly smaller than one. We
will just assume CP (B) < 1 for the following results.
It is impossible to learn the structure B of this model from observational data alone without making
further assumptions. The L INGAM approach has been extended in [11] to cyclic models, exploiting
a possible non-Gaussianity of the data. Using both experimental and interventional data, [12, 9]
could show identifiability of the connectivity matrix B under a learning mechanism that relies on
data under so-called “surgical” or “perfect” interventions. In their framework, a variable becomes
independent of all its parents if it is being intervened on and all incoming contributions are thus effectively removed under the intervention (also called do-interventions in the classical sense of [13]).
The learning mechanism makes then use of the knowledge where these “surgical” interventions occurred. [14] also allow for “changing” the incoming arrows for variables that are intervened on;
but again, [14] requires the location of the interventions while we do not assume such knowledge.
[15] consider a target variable and allow for arbitrary interventions on all other nodes. They neither
permit hidden variables nor cycles.
Here, we are interested in a setting where we have either no or just very limited knowledge about
the exact location and strength of the interventions, as is often the case for data observed under
different environments (see the example on financial time series further below) or for biological data
[16, 17]. These interventions have been called “fat-hand” or “uncertain” interventions [18]. While
[18] assume acyclicity and model the structure explicitly in a Bayesian setting, we assume that the
data in environment j are equilibrium observations of the model
xj = Bxj + cj + ej ,

(3)

where the random intervention shift cj has a mean and covariance ⌃c,j . The location of these
interventions (or simply the intervened variables) are those components of cj that are not zero
with probability one. Given these locations, the interventions simply shift the variables by a value
determined by cj ; they are therefore not “surgical” but can be seen as a special case of what is
called an “imperfect”, “parametric” [19] or “dependent” intervention [20] or “mechanism change”
[21]. The matrix B and the error distribution of ej are assumed to be identical in all environments.
In contrast to the covariance matrix for the noise term ej , we do assume that ⌃c,j is a diagonal
1
The blocking of all but one cycle can be achieved by do-interventions on appropriate variables under the
following condition: for every pair of cycles in the graph, the variables in one cycle cannot be a subset of the
variables in the other cycle. Otherwise the blocking could be achieved by deletion of appropriate edges.

matrix, which is equivalent to demanding that interventions at different variables are uncorrelated.
This is a key assumption necessary to identify the model using experimental data. Furthermore, we
will discuss in Section 4.2 how a violation of the model assumption (3) can be detected and used to
estimate the location of the interventions.
In Section 2 we show how to leverage observations under different environments with different interventional distributions to learn the structure of the connectivity matrix B in model (3). The method
rests on a simple joint matrix diagonalization. We will prove necessary and sufficient conditions for
identifiability in Section 3. Numerical results for simulated data and applications in flow cytometry
and financial data are shown in Section 4.

2.1

Method
Grouping of data

Let J be the set of experimental conditions under which we observe equilibrium data from
model (3). These different experimental conditions can arise in two ways: (a) a controlled experiment was conducted where the external input or the external imperfect interventions have been
deliberately changed from one member of J to the next. An example are the flow cytometry data
[22] discussed in Section 4.2. (b) The data are recorded over time. It is assumed that the external input is changing over time but not in an explicitly controlled way. The data are grouped into
consecutive blocks j 2 J of observations, see Section 4.3 for an example.
2.2

Notation

Assume we have nj observations in each setting j 2 J . Let Xj be the (nj ⇥ p)-matrix of observations from model (3). For general random variables aj 2 Rp , the population covariance matrix
in setting j 2 J is called ⌃a,j = Cov(aj ), where the covariance is under the setting j 2 J .
Furthermore, the covariance on all settings except setting j 2 J P
is defined as an average over all
environments except for the j-th environment, (|J | 1)⌃c, j := j 0 2J \{j} ⌃c,j 0 . The population
ˆ a,j be the empirical
Gram matrix is defined as Ga,j = E(aj aj T ). Let the (p ⇥ p)-dimensional ⌃
covariance matrix of the observations Aj 2 Rnj ⇥p of variable aj in setting j 2 J . More precisely,
ˆ a,j := (nj 1) 1 ÃT Ãj . The
let Ãj be the column-wise mean-centered version of Aj . Then ⌃
j
1 T
empirical Gram matrix is denoted by Ĝa,j := nj Aj Aj .
2.3

Assumptions

The main assumptions have been stated already but we give a summary below.
(A) The data are observations of the equilibrium observations of model (3). The matrix I B is
invertible and the solutions to (3) are thus well defined. The cycle-product (2) CP (B) is strictly
smaller than one. The diagonal entries of B are zero.
(B) The distribution of the noise ej (which includes the influence of latent variables) and the connectivity matrix B are identical across all settings j 2 J . In each setting j 2 J , the intervention shift cj and the noise ej are uncorrelated.
(C) Interventions at different variables in the same setting are uncorrelated, that is ⌃c,j is an (unknown) diagonal matrix for all j 2 J .
We will discuss a stricter version of (C) in Section D in the Appendix that allows the use of Gram
matrices instead of covariance matrices. The conditions above imply that the environments are
characterized by different interventions strength, as measured by the variance of the shift c in each
setting. We aim to reconstruct both the connectivity matrix B from observations in different environments and also aim to reconstruct the a-priori unknown intervention strength and location in
each environment. Additionally, we will show examples where we can detect violations of the model
assumptions and use these to reconstruct the location of interventions.
2.4

Population method

The main idea is very simple. Looking at the model (3), we can rewrite
(I B)xj = cj + ej .
3

(4)

The population covariance of the transformed observations are then for all settings j 2 J given by
(I B)⌃x,j (I B)T = ⌃c,j + ⌃e .
(5)
The last term ⌃e is constant across all settings j 2 J (but not necessarily diagonal as we allow
hidden variables). Any change of the matrix on the left-hand side thus stems from a shift in the
covariance matrix ⌃c,j of the interventions. Let us define the difference between the covariance
of c and x in setting j as
⌃c,j := ⌃c,j ⌃c, j , and
⌃x,j := ⌃x,j ⌃x, j .
(6)
Assumption (B) together with (5) implies that
(I B) ⌃x,j (I B)T = ⌃c,j
8j 2 J .
(7)
Using assumption (C), the random intervention shifts at different variables are uncorrelated and the
right-hand side in (7) is thus a diagonal matrix for all j 2 J . Let D ⇢ Rp⇥p be the set of all
invertible matrices. We also define a more restricted space Dcp which only includes those members
of D that have entries all equal to one on the diagonal and have a cycle-product less than one,
n
o
D := D 2 Rp⇥p : D invertible

Dcp := D 2 Rp⇥p : D 2 D and diag(D) ⌘ 1 and CP (I D) < 1 .

k6=l

is the loss L for any matrix A and defined as the sum of the squared off-diagonal elements. In
Section 3, we present necessary and sufficient conditions on the interventions under which D =
I B is the unique minimizer of (10). In this case, exact joint diagonalization is possible so that
L(D ⌃x,j DT ) = 0 for all environments j 2 J . We discuss an alternative that replaces covariance
with Gram matrices throughout in Section D in the Appendix. We now give a finite-sample version.
2.5

Finite-sample estimate of the connectivity matrix

In practice, we estimate B by minimizing Algorithm 1 BACK S HIFT
the empirical counterpart of (10) in two

steps. First, the solution of the optimiza⌃x,j 8j 2 J
tion is only constrained to matrices in D. 1: Compute d

the solution to be a member of Dcp . The 3: D̂ = PermuteAndScale(D̃)

steps in more detail below.
Steps 1 & 2. First, we minimize the following empirical, less constrained variant of (10)

(11)

j2J

where the population differences between covariance matrices are replaced with their empirical
counterparts and the only constraint on the solution is that it is invertible, i.e. D̃ 2 D. For the
optimization we use the joint approximate matrix diagonalization algorithm FFD IAG [23].
Step 3. The constraint on the cycle product and the diagonal elements of D is enforced by (a)
permuting and (b) scaling the rows of D̃. Part (b) simply scales the rows so that the diagonal
elements of the resulting matrix D̂ are all equal to one. The more challenging first step (a) consists
of finding a permutation such that under this permutation the scaled matrix from part (b) will have
a cycle product as small as possible (as follows from Theorem 3, at most one permutation can lead
to a cycle product less than one). This optimization problem seems computationally challenging at
first, but we show that it can be solved by a variant of the linear assignment problem (LAP) (see e.g.
[24]), as proven in Theorem 3 in the Appendix. As a last step, we check whether the cycle product
of D̂ is less than one, in which case we have found the solution. Otherwise, no solution satisfying
the model assumptions exists and we return a warning that the model assumptions are not met. See
Appendix B for more details.

Computational cost. The computational complexity of BACK S HIFT is O(|J |·n·p2 ) as computing
the covariance matrices costs O(|J |·n·p2 ), FFD IAG has a computational cost of O(|J |·p2 ) and both
the linear assignment problem and computing the cycle product can be solved in O(p3 ) time. For
instance, this complexity is achieved when using the Hungarian algorithm for the linear assignment
problem (see e.g. [24]) and the cycle product can be computed with a simple dynamic programming
approach.
2.6

Estimating the intervention variances

One additional benefit of BACK S HIFT is that the location and strength of the interventions can be
estimated from the data. The empirical, plug-in version of Eq. (7) is given by
(I

B̂) d
⌃x,j (I

b c,j
B̂)T = d
⌃c,j = ⌃

b c,
⌃

j

8j 2 J .

(12)

So the element ( d
⌃c,j )kk is an estimate for the difference between the variance of the intervention at variable k in environment j, namely (⌃c,j )kk , and the average in all other environments,
(⌃c, j )kk . From these differences we can compute the intervention variance for all environments
up to an offset. By convention, we set the minimal intervention variance across all environments
equal to zero. Alternatively, one can let observational data, if available, serve as a baseline against
which the intervention variances are measured.

3

Identifiability

Let for simplicity of notation,
⌘ j,k := ( ⌃c,j )kk
be the variance of the random intervention shifts cj at node k in environment j 2 J as per the
definition of ⌃c,j in (6). We then have the following identifiability result (the proof is provided
in Appendix A).
Theorem 1. Under assumptions (A), (B) and (C), the solution to (10) is unique if and only if for all
k, l 2 {1, . . . , p} there exist j, j 0 2 J such that
⌘ j,k ⌘ j 0 ,l 6= ⌘ j,l ⌘ j 0 ,k .

(13)

If none of the intervention variances ⌘ j,k vanishes, the uniqueness condition is equivalent to demanding that the ratio between the intervention variances for two variables k, l must not stay identical across all environments, that is there exist j, j 0 2 J such that
⌘ j,k
⌘ j 0 ,k
6=
,
(14)
⌘ j,l
⌘ j 0 ,l
which requires that the ratio of the variance of the intervention shifts at two nodes k, l is not identical
across all settings. This leads to the following corollary.
Corollary 2. (i) The identifiability condition (13) cannot be satisfied if |J | = 2 since then ⌘ j,k =
⌘ j 0 ,k for all k and j 6= j 0 . We need at least three different environments for identifiability.
(ii) The identifiability condition (13) is satisfied for all |J | 3 almost surely if the variances of the
intervention cj are chosen independently (over all variables and environments j 2 J ) from a
distribution that is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure.
Condition (ii) can be relaxed but shows that we can already achieve full identifiability with a very
generic setting for three (or more) different environments.

Numerical results

In this section, we present empirical results for both synthetic and real data sets. In addition to
estimating the connectivity matrix B, we demonstrate various ways to estimate properties of the
interventions. Besides computing the point estimate for BACK S HIFT, we use stability selection [25]
to assess the stability of retrieved edges. We attach R-code with which all simulations and analyses
can be reproduced2 .

Figure 2: Point estimates of

BACK S HIFT and L ING for synthetic data. We threshold the point estimate of
at t = ±0.25 to exclude those entries which are close to zero. We then threshold the estimate of
L ING so that the two estimates have the same number of edges. In Setting 4, we threshold L ING at t = ±0.25
as BACK S HIFT returns the empty graph. In Setting 3, it is not possible to achieve the same number of edges as
all remaining coefficients in the point estimate of L ING are equal to one in absolute value. The transparency
of the edges illustrates the relative magnitude of the estimated coefficients. We report the structural Hamming
distance (SHD) for each graph. Precision and recall values are shown in Figure 1(c).
BACK S HIFT

4.1

Synthetic data

We compare the point estimate of BACK S HIFT against L ING [11], a generalization of L INGAM to
the cyclic case for purely observational data. We consider the cyclic graph shown in Figure 1(a) and
generate data under different scenarios. The data generating mechanism is sketched in Figure 1(b).
Specifically, we generate ten distinct environments with non-Gaussian noise. In each environment,
the random intervention variable is generated as (cj )k = kj Ikj , where 1j , . . . , pj are drawn i.i.d.
from Exp(mI ) and I1j , . . . , Ipj are independent standard normal random variables. The intervention
shift thus acts on all observed random variables. The parameter mI regulates the strength of the
intervention. If hidden variables exist, the noise term (ej )k of variable k in environment j is equal to
j
k W , where the weights 1 , . . . , p are sampled once from a N (0, 1)-distribution and the random
variable W j has a Laplace(0, 1) distribution. If no hidden variables are present, then (ej )k , k =
1, . . . , p is sampled i.i.d. Laplace(0, 1). In this set of experiments, we consider five different settings
(described below) in which the sample size n, the intervention strength mI as well as the existence
of hidden variables varies.
We allow for hidden variables in only one out of five settings as L ING assumes causal sufficiency
and can thus in theory not cope with hidden variables. If no hidden variables are present, the pooled
data can be interpreted as coming from a model whose error variables follow a mixture distribution.
But if one of the error variables comes from the second mixture component, for example, the other

[22] and the best acyclic reconstruction by [26]. The edge thickness and intensity reflect in how many of these

not previously found in (a) or (b). (d) BACK S HIFT stability selection result with parameters E(V ) = 2 and
⇡thr = 0.75. The edge thickness illustrates how often an edge was selected in the stability selection procedure.

error variables come from the second mixture component, too. In this sense, the data points are not
independent anymore. This poses a challenge for L ING which assumes an i.i.d. sample. We also
cover a case (for mI = 0) in which all assumptions of L ING are satisfied (Scenario 4).
Figure 2 shows the estimated connectivity matrices for five different settings and Figure 1(c) shows
the obtained precision and recall values. In Setting 1, n = 1000, mI = 1 and there are no hidden
variables. In Setting 2, n is increased to 10000 while the other parameters do not change. We observe
that BACK S HIFT retrieves the correct adjacency matrix in both cases while L ING’s estimate is not
very accurate. It improves slightly when increasing the sample size. In Setting 3, we do include
hidden variables which violates the causal sufficiency assumption required for L ING. Indeed, the
estimate is worse than in Setting 2 but somewhat better than in Setting 1. BACK S HIFT retrieves
two false positives in this case. Setting 4 is not feasible for BACK S HIFT as the distribution of the
variables is identical in all environments (since mI = 0). In Step 2 of the algorithm, FFD IAG does
not converge and therefore the empty graph is returned. So the recall value is zero while precision
is not defined. For L ING all assumptions are satisfied and the estimate is more accurate than in
the Settings 1–3. Lastly, Setting 5 shows that when increasing the intervention strength to 0.5,
BACK S HIFT returns a few false positives. Its performance is then similar to L ING which returns its
most accurate estimate in this scenario. The stability selection results for BACK S HIFT are provided
in Figure 5 in Appendix E.
In short, these results suggest that the BACK S HIFT point estimates are close to the true graph if the
interventions are sufficiently strong. Hidden variables make the estimation problem more difficult
but the true graph is recovered if the strength of the intervention is increased (when increasing mI
to 1.5 in Setting 3, BACK S HIFT obtains a SHD of zero). In contrast, L ING is unable to cope with
hidden variables but also has worse accuracy in the absence of hidden variables under these shift
interventions.
4.2

Flow cytometry data

The data published in [22] is an instance of a data set where the external interventions differ between the environments in J and might act on several compounds simultaneously [18]. There are
nine different experimental conditions with each containing roughly 800 observations which correspond to measurements of the concentration of biochemical agents in single cells. The first setting
corresponds to purely observational data.
In addition to the original work by [22], the data set has been described and analyzed in [18] and
[26]. We compare against the results of [26], [22] and the “well-established consensus”, according
to [22], shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b). Figure 3(c) shows the (thresholded) BACK S HIFT point
estimate. Most of the retrieved edges were also found in at least one of the previous studies. Five
edges are reversed in our estimate and three edges were not discovered previously. Figure 3(d) shows
the corresponding stability selection result with the expected number of falsely selected variables

Figure 4: Financial time series with three stock indices: NASDAQ (blue; technology index), S&P 500 (green;
American equities) and DAX (red; German equities). (a) Prices of the three indices between May 2000 and end
of 2011 on a logarithmic scale. (b) The scaled log-returns (daily change in log-price) of the three instruments
are shown. Three periods of increased volatility are visible starting with the dot-com bust on the left to the
financial crisis in 2008 and the August 2011 downturn. (c) The scaled estimated intervention variance with
the estimated BACK S HIFT network. The three down-turns are clearly separated as originating in technology,
American and European equities. (d) In contrast, the analogous L ING estimated intervention variances have a
peak in American equities intervention variance during the European debt crisis in 2011.

E(V ) = 2. This estimate is sparser in comparison to the other ones as it bounds the number of false
discoveries. Notably, the feedback loops between PIP2 $ PLCg and PKC $ JNK were also found
in [26].
It is also noteworthy that we can check the model assumptions of shift interventions, which is important for these data as they can be thought of as changing the mechanism or activity of a biochemical
agent rather than regulate the biomarker directly [26]. If the shift interventions are not appropriate, we are in general not able to diagonalize the differences in the covariance matrices. Large
off-diagonal elements in the estimate of the r.h.s in (7) indicate a mechanism change that is not just
explained by a shift intervention as in (1). In four of the seven interventions environments with
known intervention targets the largest mechanism violation happens directly at the presumed intervention target, see Appendix C for details. It is worth noting again that the presumed intervention
target had not been used in reconstructing the network and mechanism violations.

Financial time series

Finally, we present an application in financial time series where the environment is clearly changing
over time. We consider daily data from three stock indices NASDAQ, S&P 500 and DAX for a
period between 2000-2012 and group the data into 74 overlapping blocks of 61 consecutive days
each. We take log-returns, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 4 and estimate the connectivity matrix,
which is fully connected in this case and perhaps of not so much interest in itself. It allows us,
however, to estimate the intervention strength at each of the indices according to (12), shown in
panel (c). The intervention variances separate very well the origins of the three major down-turns of
the markets on the period. Technology is correctly estimated by BACK S HIFT to be at the epicenter
of the dot-com crash in 2001 (NASDAQ as proxy), American equities during the financial crisis in
2008 (proxy is S&P 500) and European instruments (DAX as best proxy) during the August 2011
downturn.

Conclusion

We have shown that cyclic causal networks can be estimated if we obtain covariance matrices of
the variables under unknown shift interventions in different environments. BACK S HIFT leverages
solutions to the linear assignment problem and joint matrix diagonalization and the part of the computational cost that depends on the number of variables is at worst cubic. We have shown sufficient
and necessary conditions under which the network is fully identifiable, which require observations
from at least three different environments. The strength and location of interventions can also be
reconstructed.
