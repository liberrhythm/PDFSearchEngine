Abstract
This article provides the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time tmix of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at
a prescribed confidence level. The interval is computed from a single finite-length
sample path from the Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any
parameters of the chain. This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior
knowledge. The interval is constructed around the relaxation time trelax , which is
strongly related
√ to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero
roughly at a n rate, where n is the length of the sample path. Upper and lower
bounds are given on the number of samples required to achieve constant-factor
multiplicative accuracy. The lower bounds indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure can achieve this accuracy level before
seeing each state at least Ω(trelax ) times on the average. Finally, future directions
of research are identified.

Introduction

This work tackles the challenge of constructing fully empirical bounds on the mixing time of
Markov chains based on a single sample path. Let (Xt )t=1,2,... be an irreducible, aperiodic timehomogeneous Markov chain on a finite state space [d] := {1, 2, . . . , d} with transition matrix P .
Under this assumption, the chain converges to its unique stationary distribution π = (πi )di=1 regardless of the initial state distribution q:
lim Prq (Xt = i) = lim (qP t )i = πi

t→∞

t→∞

for each i ∈ [d].

The mixing time tmix of the Markov chain is the number of time steps required for the chain to be
within a fixed threshold of its stationary distribution:

Here, π(A) = i∈A πi is the probability assigned to set A by π, and the supremum is over all
possible initial distributions q. The problem studied in this work is the construction of a non-trivial
confidence interval Cn = Cn (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn , δ) ⊂ [0, ∞], based only on the observed sample
path (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn ) and δ ∈ (0, 1), that succeeds with probability 1 − δ in trapping the value of
the mixing time tmix .
This problem is motivated by the numerous scientificPapplications and machine learning tasks in
which the quantity of interest is the mean π(f ) =
i πi f (i) for some function f of the states
of a Markov chain. This is the setting of the celebrated Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
paradigm [1], but the problem also arises in performance prediction involving time-correlated data,
as is common in reinforcement learning [2]. Observable bounds on mixing times are useful in the

design and diagnostics of these methods; they yield effective approaches to assessing the estimation
quality, even when a priori knowledge of the mixing time or correlation structure is unavailable.
Main results. We develop the first procedure for constructing non-trivial and fully empirical confidence intervals for Markov mixing time. Consider a reversible ergodic Markov chain on d states
with absolute spectral gap γ⋆ and stationary distribution minorized by π⋆ . As is well-known [3,
Theorems 12.3 and 12.4],
(trelax − 1) ln 2 ≤ tmix ≤ trelax ln

where trelax := 1/γ⋆ is the relaxation time. Hence, it suffices to estimate γ⋆ and π⋆ . Our main
results are summarized as follows.
1. In Section 3.1, we show that in some problems n = Ω((d log d)/γ⋆ + 1/π⋆ ) observations
are necessary for any procedure to guarantee constant multiplicative accuracy in estimating
γ⋆ (Theorems 1 and 2). Essentially, in some problems every state may need to be visited
about log(d)/γ⋆ times, on average, before an accurate estimate of the mixing time can be
provided, regardless of the actual estimation procedure used.
2. In Section 3.2, we give a point-estimator for γ⋆ , and prove in Theorem 3 that it achieves
multiplicative accuracy from a single sample path of length Õ(1/(π⋆ γ⋆3 )).1 We also provide a point-estimator for π⋆ that requires a sample path of length Õ(1/(π⋆ γ⋆ )). This
establishes the feasibility of estimating the mixing time in this setting. However, the valid
confidence intervals suggested by Theorem 3 depend on the unknown quantities π⋆ and
γ⋆ . We also discuss the importance of reversibility, and some possible extensions to nonreversible chains.
3. In Section 4, the construction of valid fully empirical confidence intervals for π⋆ and γ⋆
are considered. First, the difficulty of the task is explained, i.e., why the standard approach
of turning the finite time confidence intervals of Theorem 3 into a fully empirical one fails.
Combining several results from perturbation theory in a novel fashion we propose a new
procedure and prove that it avoids slow convergence (Theorem 4). We also explain how
to combine the empirical confidence intervals from Algorithm 1 with the non-empirical
bounds from Theorem 3 to produce valid empirical confidence intervals. We prove in
Theorem 5 that the width of these new intervals converge to zero asymptotically at least as
fast as those from either Theorem 3 and Theorem 4.
Related work. There is a vast statistical literature on estimation in Markov chains. For instance, it
is known that under the assumptions
Pn on (Xt )t from above, the law of large numbers guarantees that
the sample mean π n (f ) := n1 t=1 f (Xt ) converges almost surely to π(f ) [4], while the central
√
limit theorem tells us that as n → ∞, the distribution of the deviation n(π n (f ) − π(f )) will be
normal with mean zero and asymptotic variance limn→∞ n Var (π n (f )) [5].
Although these asymptotic results help us understand the limiting behavior of the sample mean
over a Markov chain, they say little about the finite-time non-asymptotic behavior, which is often
needed for the prudent evaluation of a method or even its algorithmic design [6–13]. To address
this need, numerous works have developed Chernoff-type bounds on Pr(|π n (f ) − π(f )| > ǫ), thus
providing valuable tools for non-asymptotic probabilistic analysis [6, 14–16]. These probability
bounds are larger than corresponding bounds for independent and identically distributed (iid) data
due to the temporal dependence; intuitively, for the Markov chain to yield a fresh draw Xt′ that
behaves as if it was independent of Xt , one must wait Θ(tmix ) time steps. Note that the bounds
generally depend on distribution-specific properties of the Markov chain (e.g., P , tmix , γ⋆ ), which
are often unknown a priori in practice. Consequently, much effort has been put towards estimating
these unknown quantities, especially in the context of MCMC diagnostics, in order to provide datadependent assessments of estimation accuracy [e.g., 11, 12, 17–19]. However, these approaches
generally only provide asymptotic guarantees, and hence fall short of our goal of empirical bounds
that are valid with any finite-length sample path.
Learning with dependent data is another main motivation to our work. Many results from statistical learning and empirical process theory have been extended to sufficiently fast mixing, dependent

data [e.g., 20–26], providing learnability assurances (e.g., generalization error bounds). These results are often given in terms of mixing coefficients, which can be consistently estimated in some
cases [27]. However, the convergence rates of the estimates from [27], which are needed to derive
confidence bounds, are given in terms of unknown mixing coefficients. When the data comes from a
Markov chain, these mixing coefficients can often be bounded in terms of mixing times, and hence
our main results provide a way to make them fully empirical, at least in the limited setting we study.
It is possible to eliminate many of the difficulties presented above when allowed more flexible access
to the Markov chain. For example, given a sampling oracle that generates independent transitions
from any given state (akin to a “reset” device), the mixing time becomes an efficiently testable
property in the sense studied in [28, 29]. On the other hand, when one only has a circuit-based
description of the transition probabilities of a Markov chain over an exponentially-large state space,
there are complexity-theoretic barriers for many MCMC diagnostic problems [30].

Preliminaries
Notations

We denote the set of positive integers by N, and the set of the first d positive integers {1, 2, . . . , d}
by [d]. The non-negative part of a real number x is [x]+ := max{0, x}, and ⌈x⌉+ := max{0, ⌈x⌉}.
We use ln(·) for natural logarithm, and log(·) for logarithm with an arbitrary constant base. Boldface symbols are used for vectors and matrices (e.g., v, M ), and their entries are referenced by
subindexing (e.g., vi , Mi,j ). For a vector v, kvk denotes its Euclidean norm; for a matrix M , kM k
denotes its spectral norm. We use Diag(v) to denote the diagonal matrix whose (i, i)-th entry is vi .
Pd
The probability simplex is denoted by ∆d−1 = {p ∈ [0, 1]d : i=1 pi = 1}, and we regard vectors
in ∆d−1 as row vectors.
2.2

Setting

Let P ∈ (∆d−1 )d ⊂ [0, 1]d×d be a d × d row-stochastic matrix for an ergodic (i.e., irreducible
and aperiodic) Markov chain. This implies there is a unique stationary distribution π ∈ ∆d−1 with
πi > 0 for all i ∈ [d] [3, Corollary 1.17]. We also assume that P is reversible (with respect to π):
πi Pi,j = πj Pj,i ,

i, j ∈ [d].

(3)

The minimum stationary probability is denoted by π⋆ := mini∈[d] πi .
Define the matrices
M := Diag(π)P

and

L := Diag(π)−1/2 M Diag(π)−1/2 .

The (i, j)th entry of the matrix Mi,j contains the doublet probabilities associated with P : Mi,j =
πi Pi,j is the probability of seeing state i followed by state j when the chain is started from its
stationary distribution. The matrix M is symmetric on account of the reversibility of P , and hence
it follows that L is also symmetric. (We will strongly exploit the symmetry in our results.) Further,
L = Diag(π)1/2 P Diag(π)−1/2 , hence L and P are similar and thus their eigenvalue systems are
identical. Ergodicity and reversibility imply that the eigenvalues of L are contained in the interval
(−1, 1], and that 1 is an eigenvalue of L with multiplicity 1 [3, Lemmas 12.1 and 12.2]. Denote and
order the eigenvalues of L as
1 = λ1 > λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λd > −1.

Let λ⋆ := max{λ2 , |λd |}, and define the (absolute) spectral gap to be γ⋆ := 1−λ⋆ , which is strictly
positive on account of ergodicity.
Let (Xt )t∈N be a Markov chain whose transition probabilities are governed by P . For each t ∈ N,
let π (t) ∈ ∆d−1 denote the marginal distribution of Xt , so
π (t+1) = π (t) P ,

Note that the initial distribution π

(1)

t ∈ N.

is arbitrary, and need not be the stationary distribution π.

The goal is to estimate π⋆ and γ⋆ from the length n sample path (Xt )t∈[n] , and also to construct fully
empirical confidence intervals that π⋆ and γ⋆ with high probability; in particular, the construction
3

of the intervals should not depend on any unobservable quantities, including π⋆ and γ⋆ themselves.
As mentioned in the introduction, it is well-known that the mixing time of the Markov chain tmix
(defined in Eq. 1) is bounded in terms of π⋆ and γ⋆ , as shown in Eq. (2). Moreover, convergence
rates for empirical processes on Markov chain sequences are also often given in terms of mixing
coefficients that can ultimately be bounded in terms of π⋆ and γ⋆ (as we will show in the proof of
our first result). Therefore, valid confidence intervals for π⋆ and γ⋆ can be used to make these rates
fully observable.

Point estimation

In this section, we present lower and upper bounds on achievable rates for estimating the spectral
gap as a function of the length of the sample path n.
3.1

Lower bounds

The purpose of this section is to show lower bounds on the number of observations necessary to
achieve a fixed multiplicative (or even just additive) accuracy in estimating the spectral gap γ⋆ . By
Eq. (2), the multiplicative accuracy lower bound for γ⋆ gives the same lower bound for estimating
the mixing time. Our first result holds even for two state Markov chains and shows that a sequence
length of Ω(1/π⋆ ) is necessary to achieve even a constant additive accuracy in estimating γ⋆ .
Theorem 1. Pick any π̄ ∈ (0, 1/4). Consider any estimator γ̂⋆ that takes as input a random
sample path of length n ≤ 1/(4π̄) from a Markov chain starting from any desired initial state
distribution. There exists a two-state ergodic and reversible Markov chain distribution with spectral
gap γ⋆ ≥ 1/2 and minimum stationary probability π⋆ ≥ π̄ such that
Pr [|γ̂⋆ − γ⋆ | ≥ 1/8] ≥ 3/8.
Next, considering d state chains, we show that a sequence of length Ω(d log(d)/γ⋆ ) is required to
estimate γ⋆ up to a constant multiplicative accuracy. Essentially, the sequence may have to visit all
d states at least log(d)/γ⋆ times each, on average. This holds even if π⋆ is within a factor of two of
the largest possible value of 1/d that it can take, i.e., when π is nearly uniform.
Theorem 2. There is an absolute constant c > 0 such that the following holds. Pick any positive
integer d ≥ 3 and any γ̄ ∈ (0, 1/2). Consider any estimator γ̂⋆ that takes as input a random sample
path of length n < cd log(d)/γ̄ from a d-state reversible Markov chain starting from any desired
initial state distribution. There is an ergodic and reversible Markov chain distribution with spectral
gap γ⋆ ∈ [γ̄, 2γ̄] and minimum stationary probability π⋆ ≥ 1/(2d) such that
Pr [|γ̂⋆ − γ⋆ | ≥ γ̄/2] ≥ 1/4.
The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are given in Appendix A.2
3.2

A plug-in based point estimator and its accuracy

Let us now consider the problem of estimating γ⋆ . For this, we construct a natural plug-in estimator.
Along the way, we also provide an estimator for the minimum stationary probability, allowing one
to use the bounds from Eq. (2) to trap the mixing time.

The proof of Theorem 3 is based on analyzing the convergence of the sample averages M
to their expectation, and then using perturbation bounds for eigenvalues to derive a bound on the
error of γ̂⋆ . However, since these averages are formed using a single sample path from a (possibly)
non-stationary Markov chain, we cannot use standard large deviation bounds; moreover applying
c would result in a significantly worse
Chernoff-type bounds for Markov chains to each entry of M
sequence length requirement, roughly a factor of d larger. Instead, we adapt probability tail bounds
for sums of independent random matrices [32] to our non-iid setting by directly applying a blocking
technique of [33] as described in the article of [20]. Due to ergodicity, the convergence rate can be
bounded without any dependence on the initial state distribution π (1) . The proof of Theorem 3 is
given in Appendix B.
Note that because the eigenvalues of L are the same as that of the transition probability matrix P ,
we could have instead opted to estimate P , say, using simple frequency estimates obtained from
b.
the sample path, and then computing the second largest eigenvalue of this empirical estimate P
In fact, this approach is a way to extend to non-reversible chains, as we would no longer rely on
the symmetry of M or L. The difficulty with this approach is that P lacks the structure required
by certain strong eigenvalue perturbation results. One could instead invoke the Ostrowski-Elsner
theorem [cf. Theorem 1.4 on Page 170 of 34], which bounds the matching distance between the

eigenvalues of a matrix A and its perturbation A + E by O(kEk1/d ). Since kP
to be of size O(n−1/2 ), this approach will give a confidence interval for γ⋆ whose width shrinks
at a rate of O(n−1/(2d) )—an exponential slow-down compared to the rate from Theorem 3. As
demonstrated through an example from [34], the dependence on the d-th root of the norm of the
perturbation cannot be avoided in general. Our approach based on estimating a symmetric matrix
affords us the use of perturbation results that exploit more structure.
Returning to the question of obtaining a fully empirical confidence interval for γ⋆ and π⋆ , we notice
that, unfortunately, Theorem 3 falls short of being directly suitable for this, at least without further
assumptions. This is because the deviation terms themselves depend inversely both on γ⋆ and π⋆ ,
and hence can never rule out 0 (or an arbitrarily small positive value) as a possibility for γ⋆ or π⋆ .3
In effect, the fact that the Markov chain could be slow mixing and the long-term frequency of some
3
Using Theorem 3, it is possible to trap γ⋆ in the union of two empirical confidence intervals—one around
γ̂⋆ and the other around zero, both of which shrink in width as the sequence length increases.

states could be small makes it difficult to be confident in the estimates provided by γ̂⋆ and π̂⋆ . This
suggests that in order to obtain fully empirical confidence intervals, we need an estimator that is not
subject to such effects—we pursue this in Section 4. Theorem 3 thus primarily serves as a point
of comparison for what is achievable in terms of estimation accuracy when one does not need to
provide empirical confidence bounds.

Fully empirical confidence intervals

In this section, we address the shortcoming of Theorem 3 and give fully empirical confidence intervals for the stationary probabilities and the spectral gap γ⋆ . The main idea is to use the Markov
property to eliminate the dependence of the confidence intervals on the unknown quantities (including π⋆ and γ⋆ ). Specifically, we estimate the transition probabilities from the sample path using
simple frequency estimates: as a consequence of the Markov property, for each state, the frequency
estimates converge at a rate that depends only on the number of visits to the state, and in particular
the rate (given the visit count of the state) is independent of the mixing time of the chain.
6

As discussed in Section 3, it is possible to form a confidence interval for γ⋆ based on the eigenvalues of an estimated transition probability matrix by appealing to the Ostrowski-Elsner theorem.
However, as explained earlier, this would lead to a slow O(n−1/(2d) ) rate. We avoid this slow rate
by using an estimate of the symmetric matrix L, so that we can use a stronger perturbation result
(namely Weyl’s inequality, as in the proof of Theorem 3) available for symmetric matrices.
To form an estimate of L based on an estimate of the transition probabilities, one possibility is
to estimate π using a frequency-based estimate for π as was done in Section 3, and appeal to
the relation L = Diag(π)1/2 P Diag(π)−1/2 to form a plug-in estimate. However, as noted in
Section 3.2, confidence intervals for the entries of π formed this way may depend on the mixing
time. Indeed, such an estimate of π does not exploit the Markov property.
We adopt a different strategy for estimating π, which leads to our construction of empirical confib using smoothed frequency estimates
dence intervals, detailed in Algorithm 1. We form the matrix P

It is easy to combine Theorems 3 and 4 to yield intervals whose widths shrink at least as fast
as both the non-empirical intervals from Theorem 3 and the empirical intervals from Theorem 4.
Specifically, determine lower bounds on π⋆ and γ⋆ using Algorithm 1, π⋆ ≥ mini∈[d] [π̂i − b̂]+ ,
γ⋆ ≥ [γ̂⋆ − ŵ]+ ; then plug-in these lower bounds for π⋆ and γ⋆ in the deviation bounds in Eq. (5)
from Theorem 3. This yields a new interval centered around the estimate of γ⋆ from Theorem 3,
and it no longer depends on unknown quantities. The interval is a valid 1 − 2δ probability confidence interval for γ⋆ , and for sufficiently large n, the width shrinks at the rate given in Eq. (5). We
can similarly construct an empirical confidence interval for π⋆ using Eq. (4), which is valid on the
same 1 − 2δ probability event.6 Finally, we can take the intersection of these new intervals with the
corresponding intervals from Algorithm 1. This is summarized in the following theorem, which we
prove in Appendix D.

Discussion

The construction used in Theorem 5 applies more generally: Given a confidence interval of the
form In = In (γ⋆ , π⋆ , δ) for some confidence level δ and a fully empirical confidence set En (δ)
for (γ⋆ , π⋆ ) for the same level, In′ = En (δ) ∩ ∪(γ,π)∈En (δ) In (γ, π, δ) is a valid fully empirical 2δlevel confidence interval whose asymptotic width matches that of In up to lower order terms under
reasonable assumptions on En and In . In particular, this suggests that future work should focus on
closing the gap between the lower and upper bounds on the accuracy of point-estimation. Another
interesting direction is to reduce the computation cost: The current cubic cost in the number of states
can be too high even when the number of states is only moderately large.
Perhaps more important, however, is to extend our results to large state space Markov chains: In
most practical applications the state space is continuous or is exponentially large in some natural parameters. As follows from our lower bounds, without further assumptions, the problem of fully data
dependent estimation of the mixing time is intractable for information theoretical reasons. Interesting directions for future work thus must consider Markov chains with specific structure. Parametric
classes of Markov chains, including but not limited to Markov chains with factored transition kernels
with a few factors, are a promising candidate for such future investigations. The results presented
here are a first step in the ambitious research agenda outlined above, and we hope that they will
serve as a point of departure for further insights in the area of fully empirical estimation of Markov
chain parameters based on a single sample path.

For the π⋆ interval, we only plug-in lower bounds on π⋆ and γ⋆ only where these quantities appear as 1/π⋆
and 1/γ⋆ in Eq. (4). It is then possible to “solve” for observable bounds on π⋆ . See Appendix D for details.
