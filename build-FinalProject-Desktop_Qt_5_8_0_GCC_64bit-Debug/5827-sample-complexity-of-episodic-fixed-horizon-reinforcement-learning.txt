Abstract
Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement
learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world applications,
an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for
example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such
scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which
only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample
complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain
performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an

that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of
states |S|. The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound
leverages Bernstein’s inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finitehorizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least H 3 .

Introduction and Motivation

Consider test preparation software that tutors students for a national advanced placement exam taken
at the end of a year, or maximizing business revenue by the end of each quarter. Each individual
task instance requires making a sequence of decisions for a fixed number of steps H (e.g., tutoring
one student to take an exam in spring 2015 or maximizing revenue for the end of the second quarter
of 2014). Therefore, they can be viewed as a finite-horizon sequential decision making under uncertainty problem, in contrast to an infinite horizon setting in which the number of time steps is infinite.
When the domain parameters (e.g. Markov decision process parameters) are not known in advance,
and there is the opportunity to repeat the task many times (teaching a new student for each year’s
exam, maximizing revenue for each new quarter), this can be treated as episodic fixed-horizon reinforcement learning (RL). One important question is to understand how much experience is required
to act well in this setting. We formalize this as the sample complexity of reinforcement learning [1],
which is the number of time steps on which the algorithm may select an action whose value is not
near-optimal. RL algorithms with a sample complexity that is a polynomial function of the domain
parameters are referred to as Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) [2, 3, 4, 1]. Though there has
been significant work on PAC RL algorithms for the infinite horizon setting, there has been relatively
little work on the finite horizon scenario.
In this paper we present the first, to our knowledge, lower bound, and a new upper bound on the
sample complexity of episodic finite horizon PAC reinforcement learning in discrete state-action
spaces. Our bounds are tight up to log-factors in the time horizon H, the accuracy , the number
of actions |A| and up to an additive constant in the failure probability δ. These bounds improve
upon existing results by a factor of at least H. Our results also apply when the reward model
is a function of the within-episode time step in addition to the state and action space. While we
assume a stationary transition model, our results can be extended readily to time-dependent state1

transitions. Our proposed UCFH (Upper-confidence fixed-horizon RL) algorithm that achieves our
upper PAC guarantee can be applied directly to wide range of fixed-horizon episodic MDPs with
known rewards.1 It does not require additional structure such as assuming access to a generative
model [8] or that the state transitions are sparse or acyclic [6].
The limited prior research on upper bound PAC results for finite horizon MDPs has focused on
different settings, such as partitioning a longer trajectory into fixed length segments [4, 1], or considering a sliding time window [9]. The tightest dependence on the horizon in terms of the number
of episodes presented in these approaches is at least H 3 whereas our dependence is only H 2 . More
importantly, such alternative settings require the optimal policy to be stationary, whereas in general
in finite horizon settings the optimal policy is nonstationary (e.g. is a function of both the state and
the within episode time-step).2 Fiechter [10, 11] and Reveliotis and Bountourelis [12] do tackle a
closely related setting, but find a dependence that is at least H 4 .
Our work builds on recent work [6, 8] on PAC infinite horizon discounted RL that offers much tighter
upper and lower sample complexity bounds than was previously known. To use an infinite horizon
algorithm in a finite horizon setting, a simple change is to augment the state space by the time step
(ranging over 1, . . . , H), which enables the learned policy to be non-stationary in the original state
space (or equivalently, stationary in the newly augmented space). Unfortunately, since these recent
bounds are in general a quadratic function of the state space size, the proposed state space expansion
would introduce at least an additional H 2 factor in the sample complexity term, yielding at least a
H 4 dependence in the number of episodes for the sample complexity.
Somewhat surprisingly, we prove an upper bound on the sample complexity for the finite horizon
case that only scales quadratically with the horizon. A key part of our proof is that the variance of
the value function in the finite horizon setting satisfies a Bellman equation. We also leverage recent
insights that state–action pairs can be estimated to different precisions depending on the frequency to
which they are visited under a policy, extending these ideas to also handle when the policy followed
is nonstationary. Our lower bound analysis is quite different than some prior infinite-horizon results,
and involves a construction of parallel multi-armed bandits where it is required that the best arm in
a certain portion of the bandits is identified with high probability to achieve near-optimality.

Problem Setting and Notation

We consider episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, which can be formalized as a tuple M =
(S, A, r, p, p0 , H). Both, the statespace S and the actionspace A are finite sets. The learning agent
interacts with the MDP in episodes of H time steps. At time t = 1 . . . H, the agent observes a state
st and choses an action at based on a policy π that potentially depends on the within-episode time
step, i.e., at = πt (st ) for t = 1, . . . , H. The next state is sampled from the stationary transition
kernel st+1 ∼ p(·|st , at ) and the initial state from s1 ∼ p0 . In addition the agent receives a reward
drawn from a distribution3 with mean rt (st ) determined by the reward function. The reward function r is possibly time-dependent and takes values in
[0, 1]. The quality
of a policy π is evaluated by
hP
i
H
π

the total expected reward of an episode RM = E
t=1 rt (st ) . For simplicity, we assume that
the reward function r is known to the agent but the transition kernel p is unknown. The question
we study is how many episodes does a learning agent follow a policy π that is not -optimal, i.e.,
∗

, with probability at least 1 − δ for any chosen accuracy  and failure probability δ.
Notation. In the following sections, we reason about the true MDP M , an empirical MDP M̂ and
an optimistic MDP M̃ which are identical except for their transition probabilities p, p̂ and p̃t . We
will provide more details about these MDPs later. We introduce the notation explicitly only for M
but the quantities carry over to M̃ and M̂ with additional tildes or hats by replacing p with p̃t or p̂.
1
Previous works [5] have shown that the complexity of learning state transitions usually dominates learning
reward functions. We therefore follow existing sample complexity analyses [6, 7] and assume known rewards
for simplicity. The algorithm and PAC bound can be extended readily to the case of unknown reward functions.
2
The best action will generally depend on the state and the number of remaining time steps. In the tutoring
example, even if the student has the same state of knowledge, the optimal tutor decision may be to space
practice if there is many days till the test and provide intensive short-term practice if the test is tomorrow.
3
It is straightforward to have the reward depend on the state, or state/action or state/action/next state.

We denote by S(s, a) ⊆ S the set of possible successor states of state s and action a. The maximum
number of them is denoted by C = maxs,a∈S×A |S(s, a)|. In general, without making further
assumptions, we have C = |S|, though in many practical domains (robotics, user modeling) each
state can only transition to a subset of the full set of states (e.g. a robot can’t teleport across the
building, but can only take local moves). The notation Õ is similar to the usual O-notation but
ignores log-terms. More precisely f = Õ(g) if there are constants c1 , c2 such that f ≤ c1 g(ln g)c2
and analogously for Ω̃. The natural logarithm is ln and log = log2 is the base-2 logarithm.

Upper PAC-Bound

We now introduce a new model-based algorithm, UCFH, for RL in finite horizon episodic domains.
We will later prove UCFH is PAC with an upper bound on its sample complexity that is smaller
than prior approaches. Like many other PAC RL algorithms [3, 13, 14, 15], UCFH uses an optimism under uncertainty approach to balance exploration and exploitation. The algorithm generally
works in phases comprised of optimistic planning, policy execution and model updating that take
several episodes each. Phases are indexed by k. As the agent acts in the environment and observes
(s, a, r, s0 ) tuples, UCFH maintains a confidence set over the possible transition parameters for each
state-action pair that are consistent with the observed transitions. Defining such a confidence set that
holds with high probability can be be achieved using concentration inequalities like the Hoeffding
inequality. One innovation in our work is to use a particular new set of conditions to define the confidence set that enables us to obtain our tighter bounds. We will discuss the confidence sets further
below. The collection of these confidence sets together form a class of MDPs Mk that are consistent
with the observed data. We define M̂k as the maximum likelihood estimate of the MDP given the
previous observations.
Given Mk , UCFH computes a policy π k by performing optimistic planning. Specifically, we use
a finite horizon variant of extended value iteration (EVI) [5, 14]. EVI performs modified Bellman
backups that are optimistic with respect to a given set of parameters. That is, given a confidence
set of possible transition model parameters, it selects in each time step the model within that set
that maximizes the expected sum of future rewards. Appendix A provides more details about fixed
horizon EVI.
UCFH then executes π k until there is a state-action pair (s, a) that has been visited often enough
since its last update (defined precisely in the until-condition in UCFH). After updating the model
statistics for this (s, a)-pair, a new policy π k+1 is obtained by optimistic planning again. We refer to
each such iteration of planning-execution-update as a phase with index k. If there is no ambiguity,
we omit the phase indices k to avoid cluttered notation.
UCFH is inspired by the infinite-horizon UCRL-γ algorithm by Lattimore and Hutter [6] but has
several important differences. First, the policy can only be updated at the end of an episode, so
there is no need for explicit delay phases as in UCRL-γ. Second, the policies π k in UCFH are
time-dependent. Finally, UCFH can directly deal with non-sparse transition probabilities, whereas
UCRL-γ only directly allows two possible successor states for each (s, a)-pair (C = 2).
Confidence sets. The class of MDPs Mk consists of fixed-horizon MDPs M 0 with the known true
reward function r and where the transition probability p0t (s0 |s, a) from any (s, a) ∈ S × A to s0 ∈
S(s, a) at any time t is in the confidence set induced by p̂(s0 |s, a) of the empirical MDP M̂ . Solely
for the purpose of computationally more efficient optimistic planning, we allow time-dependent
transitions (allows choosing different transition models in different time steps to maximize reward),
but this does not affect the theoretical guarantees as the true stationary MDP is still in Mk with high
4

The definition also works for time-dependent transition probabilities.

probability. Unlike the confidence intervals used by Lattimore and Hutter [6], we not only include
conditions based on Hoeffding’s inequality5 and Bernstein’s inequality (Eq. 2), but also require that
the variance p(1 − p) of the Bernoulli random variable associated with this transition is close to the
empirical one (Eq. 1). This additional condition (Eq. 1) is key for making the algorithm directly
applicable to generic MDPs (in which states can transition to any number of next states, e.g. C > 2)
while only having a linear dependency on C in the PAC bound.
3.1 PAC Analysis
For simplicity we assume that each episode starts in a fixed start state s0 . This assumption is not
crucial and can easily be removed by additional notational effort.

Similarities to other analyses. The proof of Theorem 1 is quite long and involved, but builds on
similar techniques for sample-complexity bounds in reinforcement learning (see e.g. Brafman and
Tennenholtz [3], Strehl and Littman [16]). The general proof strategy is closest to the one of UCRL-γ
[6] and the obtained bounds are similar if we replace the time horizon H with the equivalent in the
discounted case 1/(1 − γ). However, there are important differences that we highlight now briefly.
• A central quantity in the analysis by Lattimore and Hutter [6] is the local variance of the value
function. The exact definition for the fixed-horizon case will be given below. The key insight for
the almost tight bounds of Lattimore and Hutter [6] and Azar et al. [8] is to leverage the fact that
these local variances satisfy a Bellman equation [17] and so the discounted sum of local variances
can be bounded by O((1 − γ)−2 ) instead of O((1 − γ)−3 ). We prove in Lemma 4 that local value
2
function variances σi:j
also satisfy a Bellman equation for fixed-horizon MDPs even if transition
probabilities and rewards are time-dependent. This allows us to bound the total sum of local
variances by O(H 2 ) and obtain similarly strong results in this setting.
• Lattimore and Hutter [6] assumed there are only two possible successor states (i.e., C = 2) which
2
allows them to easily relate the local variances σi:j
to the difference of the expected value of
successor states in the true and optimistic MDP (Pi − P̃i )Ṽi+1:j . For C > 2, the relation is less
clear, but we address this by proving a bound with tight dependencies on C (Lemma C.6).
• To avoid super-linear dependency on C in the final PAC bound, we add the additional condition
in Equation (1) to the confidence set. We show that this allows us to upper-bound the total reward
k
2
difference R∗ − Rπ of policy π k with terms that either depend on σi:j
or decrease linearly in
the number of samples. This gives the desired linear dependency on C in the final bound. We
therefore avoid assuming C = 2 which makes UCFH directly applicable to generic MDPs with
C > 2 without the impractical transformation argument used by Lattimore and Hutter [6].
We will now introduce the notion of knownness and importance of state-action pairs that is essential
for the analysis of UCFH and subsequently present several lemmas necessary for the proof of Theorem 1. We only sketch proofs here but detailed proofs for all results are available in the appendix.
Fine-grained categorization of (s, a)-pairs. Many PAC RL sample complexity proofs [3, 4, 13,
14] only have a binary notion of “knownness”, distinguishing between known (transition probability estimated sufficiently accurately) and unknown (s, a)-pairs. However, as recently shown by
Lattimore and Hutter [6] for the infinite horizon setting, it is possible to obtain much tighter sample
complexity results by using a more fine grained categorization. In particular, a key idea is that in order to obtain accurate estimates of the value function of a policy from a starting state, it is sufficient
to have only a loose estimate of the parameters of (s, a)-pairs that are unlikely to be visited under
this policy.

which indicates how often (s, a) has been observed relative to its importance. The constant m is

Xk,κ,ι := {(s, a) ∈ Xk : κk (s, a) = κ, ιk (s, a) = ι}

and

X̄k = S × A \ Xk

where Xk = {(s, a) ∈ S × A : ιk (s, a) > 0} is the active set and X̄k the set of state-action pairs
that are very unlikely under the current policy. Intuitively, the model of UCFH is accurate if only few
5

(s, a) are in categories with low knownness – that is, important under the current policy but have
not been observed often so far. Recall that over time observations are generated under many policies
(as the policy is recomputed), so this condition does not always hold. We will therefore distinguish
between phases k where |Xk,κ,ι | ≤ κ for all κ and ι and phases where this condition is violated.
The condition essentially allows for only a few (s, a) in categories that are less known and more and
more (s, a) in categories that are more well known. In fact, we will show that the policy is -optimal
with high probability in phases that satisfy this condition.
We first show the validity of the confidence sets Mk .
Lemma 1 (Capturing the true MDP whp.). M ∈ Mk for all k with probability at least 1 − δ/2.
Proof Sketch. By combining Hoeffding’s inequality, Bernstein’s inequality and the concentration result on empirical variances by Maurer and Pontil [18] with the union bound, we get that p(s0 |s, a) ∈
P with probability at least 1 − δ1 for a single phase k, fixed s, a ∈ S × A and fixed s0 ∈ S(s, a). We
then show that the number of model updates is bounded by Umax and apply the union bound.
The following lemma bounds the number of episodes in which ∀κ, ι : |Xk,κ,ι | ≤ κ is violated with
high probability.

6N Emax ) ≥ 1 − δ/2 where N = |S × A| m and Emax = log2 wmin log2 |S|.
Proof Sketch. We first bound the total number of times a fixed pair (s, a) can be observed while
being in a particular category Xk,κ,ι in all phases k for 1 ≤ κ < |S|. We then show that for a
particular (κ, ι), the number of episodes where |Xk,κ,ι | > κ is bounded with high probability, as the
value of ι implies a minimum probability of observing each (s, a) pair in Xk,κ,ι in an episode. Since
the observations are not independent we use martingale concentration results to show the statement
for a fixed (κ, ι). The desired result follows with the union bound over all relevant κ and ι.
The next lemma states that in episodes where the condition ∀κ, ι : |Xk,κ,ι | ≤ κ is satisfied and the
true MDP is in the confidence set, the expected optimistic policy value is close to the true value.
This lemma is the technically most involved part of the proof.

Lower PAC Bound

Theorem 2. There exist positive constants c1 , c2 , δ0 , 0 such that for every δ ∈ (0, δ0 ) and  ∈
(0, 0 ) and for every algorithm A that satisfies a PAC guarantee for (, δ) and outputs a deterministic
policy, there is a fixed-horizon episodic MDP Mhard with

can be set to δ0 = e80 ≈ 5000
4 ≈ H/35000, c2 = 4 and c3 = e
The ranges of possible δ and  are of similar order than in other state-of-the-art lower bounds for
multi-armed bandits [19] and discounted MDPs [14, 6]. They are mostly determined by the bandit
result by Mannor and Tsitsiklis [19] we build on. Increasing the parameter limits δ0 and 0 for
bandits would immediately result in larger ranges in our lower bound, but this was not the focus of
our analysis.
Proof Sketch. The basic idea is to show that the class of MDPs shown in Figure 1 require at least a
number of observed episodes of the order of Equation (3). From the start state 0, the agent ends up
in states 1 to n with equal probability, independent of the action. From each such state i, the agent
transitions to either a good state + with reward 1 or a bad state − with reward 0 and stays there for
the rest of the episode. Therefore, each state i = 1, . . . , n is essentially a multi-armed bandit with
binary rewards of either 0 or H − 2. For each bandit, the probability of ending up in + or − is
equal except for the first action a1 with p(st+1 = +|st = i, at = a1 ) = 1/2 + /2 and possibly an
unknown optimal action a∗i (different for each state i) with p(st+1 = +|st = i, at = a∗i ) = 1/2 + .
In the episodic fixed-horizon setting we are considering, taking a suboptimal action in one of the
bandits does not necessarily yield a suboptimal episode. We have to consider the average over all
bandits instead. In an -optimal episode, the agent therefore needs to follow a policy that would
solve at least a certain portion of all n multi-armed bandits with probability at least 1 − δ. We show
that the best strategy for the agent to achieve this is to try to solve all bandits with equal probability.
The number of samples required to do so then results in the lower bound in Equation (3).
7

Similar MDPs that essentially solve multiple of such multi-armed bandits have been used to prove
lower sample-complexity bounds for discounted MDPs [14, 6]. However, the analysis in the infinite
horizon case as well as for the sliding-window fixed-horizon optimality criterion considered by
Kakade [4] is significantly simpler. For these criteria, every time step the agent follows a policy that
is not -optimal counts as a ”mistake”. Therefore, every time the agent does not pick the optimal
arm in any of the multi-armed bandits counts as a mistake. This contrasts with our fixed-horizon
setting where we must instead consider taking an average over all bandits.

Related Work on Fixed-Horizon Sample Complexity Bounds

We are not aware of any lower sample complexity bounds beyond multi-armed bandit results that
directly apply to our setting. Our upper bound in Theorem 1 improves upon existing results by at
least a factor of H. We briefly review those existing results in the following.
Timestep bounds. Kakade [4, Chapter 8] proves upper and lower PAC bounds for a similar setting where the agent interacts indefinitely with the environment but the interactions are divided in
segments of equal length and the agent is evaluated by the expected
of rewards

4
natural to consider performance on the entire episode since suboptimality near the end of the episode
is no issue as long as the total reward on the entire episode is sufficiently high. Kolter and Ng [9]
use an interesting sliding-window criterion, but prove bounds for a Bayesian setting instead of PAC.
Timestep-based bounds can be applied to the episodic case by augmenting the original statespace
with a time-index per episode to allow resets after H steps. This adds H dependencies for each |S|
in the original bound which results in a horizon-dependency of at least H 6 of these existing bounds.
Translating the regret bounds of UCRL2 in Corollary 3by Jaksch et al. [20] yields a PAC-bound

Conclusion

We have shown upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of episodic fixed-horizon RL that
are tight up to log-factors in the time horizon H, the accuracy , the number of actions |A| and up
to an additive constant in the failure probability δ. These bounds improve upon existing results by a
factor of at least H. One might hope to reduce the dependency of the upper bound on |S| to be linear
by an analysis similar to Mormax [7] for discounted MDPs which has sample complexity linear in
|S| at the penalty of additional dependencies on H. Our proposed UCFH algorithm that achieves our
PAC bound can be applied to directly to a wide range of fixed-horizon episodic MDPs with known
rewards and does not require additional structure such as sparse or acyclic state transitions assumed
in previous work. The empirical evaluation of UCFH is an interesting direction for future work.

For comparison we adapt existing bounds to our setting. While the original bound stated by Kakade [4]
only has H 3 , an additional H 3 comes in through −3 due to different normalization of rewards.
