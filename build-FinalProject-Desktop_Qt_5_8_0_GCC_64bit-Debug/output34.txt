Two studies tested one linear and two curvilinear hypotheses concerning the relationship between political conservatism-liberalism and cognitive ability. Study 1, focusing on students at a selective US university (n = 7279), found support for the idea that some dimensions of conservatism are linked to lower
verbal ability, whereas other dimensions are linked to higher verbal ability. There was also strong support
for political extremists both on the left and right being higher in verbal ability than centrists. Study 2
employed aggregate data pertaining to the 50 US states and demonstrated that conservatism was linked
to lower cognitive ability in states with high political involvement, but found conservatism to be correlated with higher average ability in states with low political involvement. The discussion addresses
potential implications and criticisms of this research.

1. Introduction
The present research examines the hypothesis that an individual’s location on the liberal-conservative dimension is related to
an individual’s cognitive resources. Prominently, Adorno, FrenkelBrunswik, Levinson, and Sanford (1950) linked endorsing rightwing ideology to lower levels of cognitive functioning. These and
subsequent authors found conservatism to be associated with lower tolerance for ambiguity, openness to new experiences and cognitive complexity, but with higher need for structure – ﬁndings
that were largely conﬁrmed in a comprehensive review of the literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, and Sulloway (2003a).
Implicit in this research is the claim that, all else being equal,
conservative beliefs tend to be cognitively less demanding than liberal beliefs. Conservatism is oriented toward tradition and the
preservation of the status quo and, thus, entails resistance to
change and uncertainty. Further, conservatism is more likely to invoke absolutes, such as the absolute distinction of right and wrong,
the absolute sovereignty of the state or other authorities. According to various authors, conservatism is at least in part the result
of the avoidance of uncertainty and complexity, which are experienced as inherently threatening by the individual (e.g., Wilson,
1973). Conversely, this line of argument links left-wing ideologies
to embracing change and uncertainty as well as higher tolerance of
ambiguity and complexity. Though theorists often view more basic
personality characteristics as antecedents and (supposedly less ba* Tel.: +1 775 784 1287; fax: +1 775 784 1358.

sic) political ideologies as consequents, any causal claim concerning the relationship between personality and political ideology is
inherently hazardous as it is based on correlational data.
Nevertheless, the hypothesis of a positive, linear association of
conservatism and measures of cognitive functioning has received
considerable empirical support (e.g., Jost et al., 2003a); yet, others
argued that extremists at both ends of the ideological spectrum are
highly similar. For instance, Greenberg and Jonas (2003) suggested
that both right-wing and left-wing extremists are more dogmatic
and less tolerant of ambiguity than the mainstream, though
support for this hypothesis is scant (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &
Sulloway, 2003b).
Sidanius (1985) hypothesized that individuals at both ends of
the political spectrum show greater cognitive sophistication than
the mainstream. He argued that any deviation from mainstream
beliefs requires higher levels of cognitive functioning as extremists
need to be able to explain why they hold views different from the
majority. By comparison, centrists, who typically outnumber
extremists, face no similar intellectual challenges. As a result,
highly functioning individuals should be overrepresented at the
margins of the political spectrum.
1.1. Conservatism and general cognitive ability
This paper revisits the three hypotheses described above by
examining the relationship between conservatism-liberalism and
general cognitive ability (g), a potent predictor of people’s success
in life (e.g., Gottfredson, 1997). Much research on the conservatism-liberalism dimension has explored its cognitive correlates,

768

M. Kemmelmeier / Personality and Individual Differences 45 (2008) 767–772

but almost all of these studies have relied on self-report measures
of cognitive functioning, including cognitive styles or preferences,
which may or may not be correlated with standardized measures
of cognitive ability (e.g., Cacioppo & Petty, 1982; Peterson, Deary,
& Austin, 2005). Thus, it is unclear if there is a link between conservatism-liberalism and cognitive ability. Further, Lapsley and
Enright (1979) and Bouchard et al. (2003) reported a negative correlation between conservatism and general intelligence. However,
Wright and Phillips (1979) did not ﬁnd conservatism to be related
to intelligence, and Katz (2001) even reported a positive relationship between conservatism and IQ. Thus, the evidence linking conservatism-liberalism and cognitive ability is mixed at best, and
none of these studies addresses the possibility of a curvilinear
relationship.
1.2. The present series of studies
This research tests the three hypotheses outlined above for the
relationship between conservatism-liberalism and cognitive ability. Hypothesis 1 predicts there to be a linear and positive relationship between these constructs. Assuming that extremists of all
stripes are similar in their lack of cognitive resources, Hypothesis
2 predicts an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship with higher cognitive ability in the political mainstream, and lower ability
toward the extremes. Lastly, assuming that deviating from the
political mainstream requires cognitive resources, Hypothesis 3
predicts a U-shaped curvilinear relationship with higher levels of
cognitive ability toward the political extremes, and lower levels toward the center. Note that, while Hypothesis 2 and 3 make opposite predictions, Hypothesis 1 is compatible with either of the two.
Indeed, investigations examining cognitive styles have obtained
support for both Hypothesis 1 and 3 (e.g., Jost et al., 2003b).
2. Study 1
The ﬁrst study correlated college students’ conservatism-liberalism with their scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)
and the American College Test (ACT). Although both tests are typically treated as achievement tests, Frey and Detterman (2004)
demonstrated that the SAT can be used as a measure of general
cognitive ability. ACT and SAT are highly correlated (Stumpf &
Stanley, 2002) and because ACT is also strongly correlated with
verbal intelligence (Sypher & Applegate, 1982), it can serve as a
measure of cognitive ability also (cf. Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard,
et al., 1996).

continuum is the most common method used to assess political
orientation and is highly predictive of voting behavior in the US
(Jost, 2006).
2.1.2.2. Conservative attitudes. Overall, 6805 students indicated
their agreement or disagreement with 6 CIRP items concerning distinct social issues using a 4-point scale. A principal component
analysis with varimax rotation revealed two factors that accounted
for 55.6% of the overall variance. As summarized in Table 1, the
ﬁrst factor, termed ‘‘gender role attitudes,” was characterized by
high factor loadings of supporting the legality of abortions, supporting a legal marital status to same-sex couples and rejecting
the prohibition of homosexual relations. The second factor, termed
‘‘anti-regulation attitudes,” was characterized by support for federal gun control, colleges prohibiting racist and sexist speech on
campus, and higher taxes for the wealthy. Because split-half analyses revealed factor loadings to be highly reliable, weighted factor
scores were computed. Thus, the two factor scores are uncorrelated, and have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. To facilitate interpretation, factors were rescored such that higher values
indicated greater conservatism. Note that the factors reﬂect two
very distinct aspects of conservatism: social conservatism and
‘‘small government” conservatism (libertarianism).
2.1.2.3. Cognitive ability. From the registrar’s ofﬁce ACT scores and
SAT scores, separately for the mathematics (SAT-M) and verbal
(SAT-V) subsections, were obtained. SAT scores vary between 200
and 800, and ACT scores between 1 and 36. Valid ACT data were
available for 5893, and SAT data for 4082 students; 2696 students
took both tests. The mean for SAT-M was 661.63 (SD = 73.94), for
SAT-V 634.07 (SD = 74.23). The sample mean for the ACT was
27.82 (SD = 3.14).
2.1.2.4. Control variables. In all analyses students’ sex, ethnicity/
race, parental income and mother’s education were controlled.
2.2. Results
2.2.1. Correlation between SAT and ACT
Replicating earlier research, SAT and ACT where highly correlated, r(2696) = .801, p < .001. Whereas SAT-M and SAT-V were
moderately correlated, r(4082) = .370, p < .001, ACT was somewhat
more closely related to SAT-V, r(2696) = .690, p < .001, than to SATM, r(2696) = .644, p < .001.

2.1. Method
2.1.1. Participants
As part of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program
(CIRP), two entering cohorts at a large selective US university
(n = 11,088) completed a comprehensive survey (response rate
87%). Approximately 85% of respondents granted researchers permission to access their ofﬁcial test scores. The present analysis
focuses on individuals for whom self-described conservatismliberalism, a measure of cognitive ability (SAT or ACT) and all
control variables were available. Thus, the sample included 7279
students (49.3% women). Most described themselves as White
(76.3%), 12.4% as Asian American, 6.4% Black, 3.4% as Hispanic
and 1.4% as Native American.
2.1.2. Variables
2.1.2.1. Political self-description. Students were asked to describe
their political orientation as ‘‘far left” (2.3%), ‘‘liberal” (34.8%),
‘‘middle of the road” (42.5%), ‘‘conservative” (19.4%), or ‘‘far right”
(1.0%). Such a simple rating on a bipolar conservative-liberal

2.2.2. Relationship between political self-description and conservative
attitudes
Pearson correlations between self-described conservatism-liberalism and attitudes were .47 for conservative gender roles and
.22 for anti-regulation attitudes. These analyses conﬁrm a consistent relationship between conservative-liberal self-description
and attitudes, although they are hardly redundant.
2.2.3. SAT and ACT as a function of conservatism
To investigate whether conservative attitudes and self-description predict test scores, a hierarchical linear regression model was
used. In the ﬁrst step, I entered all control variables. In the second
step, the conservative attitudes scores as well as political selfdescriptions were added. In the ﬁnal step, I entered quadratic
terms for the two attitude scores and political self-descriptions
to test for a non-linear association between conservatism-liberalism and cognitive ability.
Table 2 summarizes the results of this regression model using
SAT-V, SAT-M and ACT as dependent variables. At step 1, the models replicate frequently documented effects of student background
on performance, e.g., lower scores for certain minority groups compared to European Americans.
Second, including the two attitudes scores and political selfdescriptions led to an increase in the model ﬁt for SAT-V and

ACT, as evidenced in a signiﬁcant rise of the variance explained
(DR2). Across models, self-described conservatism-liberalism as
well as conservative gender role attitudes were related to lower
SAT-V and ACT. These patterns support Hypothesis 1, i.e. a negative
linear association between conservatism-liberalism and cognitive
ability. Surprisingly, anti-regulation attitudes were positively related to both SAT-V and ACT; that is, the rejection of government
control and restrictions on free speech was linked to greater cognitive ability. Note, however, that SAT-M was not predicted by any of
the three conservatism variables.
Third, the inclusion of quadratic terms into the regression model improved the prediction of SAT-V and ACT, but again not that of
SAT-M. Inspection of the three conservatism variables shows that,
with the exception of anti-regulation attitudes and SAT-V, each
quadratic effect is statistically signiﬁcant. The positive sign of these
signiﬁcant coefﬁcients clearly refutes Hypothesis 2, but supports
Hypothesis 3’s notion that extremists are higher in cognitive ability
than centrists.
2.3. Discussion
Study 1 showed that conservatism is related to cognitive ability
as measured by widely used standardized tests shown to measure
general cognitive ability (e.g., Frey & Detterman, 2004). However,
the relationship between political self-descriptions, conservative
attitudes and cognitive ability is somewhat complex, providing
support for two of the three hypotheses tested. First, there was
substantial support for Hypothesis 1 concerning a negative, linear
relationship between conservatism and cognitive ability: conservative gender role attitudes and self-descriptions predicted SAT-V
and ACT. This pattern of ﬁndings replicates much of the results reported in the literature for other variables tapping cognitive functioning (e.g., Jost et al., 2003a). However, anti-regulation attitudes
were related to higher, not lower, SAT-V and ACT scores. This result
was not anticipated by any of the three hypotheses and diametrically contradicts Hypothesis 1, though it does replicate Katz
(2001).
Second, there was also much evidence to support Hypothesis 3,
the notion of a curvilinear relationship with political extremists
commanding greater cognitive resources than those in the political
center (Sidanius, 1985). This pattern was obtained for two conservatism-liberalism variables predicting SAT-V and three predicting
ACT. Yet, it has to be acknowledged that whenever there was a signiﬁcant quadratic term I simultaneously found a linear effect. That
is, all else being equal, self-described conservative and more liberals, as well as social conservatives and liberals differed from middling respondents, but, compared to conservatives, liberals were
still higher in SAT-V and ACT. However, the reverse pattern was
found for anti-regulation attitudes, such that, all else being equal,
more conservative respondents scored higher than more liberal
respondents.
While Study 1 revealed similar links between conservatism-liberalism, and SAT-V and ACT, SAT-M was unrelated to conservatism-liberalism variables. Thus, based on the present data
individuals high or low in conservatism (or liberalism) vary with
regard to verbal ability, but not necessarily quantitative ability.
This pattern is plausible because political discourse and argument
primarily draw upon language-based resources.
3. Study 2
A limitation of Study 1 was that it focused on students who
attended one of the top-25 US universities. Incoming students
were disproportionately from relatively wealthy, educated families, holding test scores that were on average 1.5 standard deviations above the national mean. Though college-aged US citizens

770

M. Kemmelmeier / Personality and Individual Differences 45 (2008) 767–772

are generally less likely to vote than the general population, college students are roughly twice as likely to vote compared to
non-college attending citizens of the same age (Phillips, Urbany,
& Reynolds, 2008). Further, at elite colleges student involvement
in politics tends to be quite high, with voter turnout rates often
exceeding the national average (e.g., Phillips et al., 2008). Further,
other national CIRP data indicated that the student sample of
Study 1 was almost twice as likely to become involved in student
protests, such as a grass-roots political action, than the average
US college freshman. Because personal involvement in the political domain moderates the link between personality and ideology
(e.g., Kemmelmeier, 2007), one may suspect that Study 1 ﬁndings
were contingent on high political involvement and might not
generalize to the population as a whole. Study 2 sought to test
Hypotheses 1–3 drawing on data from the entire US However,
in contrast to Study 1, the present research was conducted at
the aggregate levels, examining patterns of political leanings,
political involvement and cognitive ability at the level of US
states.
3.1. Method
The data were composed of variables obtained from various secondary-data sources for all 50 US states. All data pertained to 2004,
the year of a US general election (which included a Presidential
election).
3.1.1. Cognitive ability
McDaniel’s (2006a) estimates of cognitive ability for each US
state served as main dependent variable. McDaniel generated his
estimates based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NEAP), a large-scale program that administers standardized
tests in reading and mathematics to representative samples of
public school students in all 50 US states. State estimates were validated against a series of established correlates of intelligence and
they were shown to be superior to other efforts to assess indicators
of state-level differences in cognitive ability (McDaniel, 2006a,
2006b). McDaniel’s estimates use the metric of IQ scores, with a
mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
3.1.2. Political orientation
To gauge the general political leanings of each state I selected
the 2004 proportion of Democratic lawmakers among all lawmakers across both houses of a state’s legislature (Morgan Quitno, 2006). In the US two-party system it is well-known that
Democrats are on average more liberal than conservatives;
hence, an electorate that is more likely to vote for Democrats
to rule their state can be assumed to be more liberal. Because
the number of independents and members of other parties is
generally negligible, the proportion of Republican lawmakers is
roughly the complement to the proportion of Democrats (average
48.70%, SD = 15.64).
3.1.3. Political involvement
To measure how politically engaged the population of a state
was, I chose the ofﬁcial voter turnout rate in the 2004 general election (Morgan Quitno, 2006). Across the 50 states the mean was
61.37% (SD = 6.60).
3.1.4. Control variables
Because members of US minority groups typically score lower
on standardized tests, via the US Census Bureau I obtained the proportion of African American and Latino residents in each US state
in 2004. Similarly, gross state product per capita for 2004 was con-

trolled because of the established link between state wealth and
state-IQ (McDaniel, 2006a).
3.2. Results
Using again a hierarchical regression model, state-IQ was predicted based on voting participation rates and the proportion of
Democratic lawmakers. Following Friedrich (1982), all predictors
and the dependent variable were standardized. In the ﬁrst step I
added the control variables (DR2 = .546, p < .001), in step 2 the
linear terms for the two main predictors (DR2 = .126, p < .002),
in step 3 the quadratic term for Democratic lawmakers
(DR2 = .016, p > .15), and in Step 4 in interaction between linear
terms for voting participant and Democratic lawmakers
(DR2 = .107, p < .001). The ﬁnal model, summarized in Table 3,
explains 80% of the overall variance. There was no support for
Hypotheses 2 and 3, as the quadratic term was not signiﬁcant.
However, the signiﬁcant interaction term indicated that, at high
levels of political involvement (1 SD above the mean) there
was a positive relationship between the proportion of Democratic lawmakers and state-IQ, simple slope b = .380, p < .02. This
ﬁnding is consistent with Hypothesis 1; however, at low levels of
political involvement (1 SD below the mean) greater proportions
of Democratic lawmakers were linked to lower state-IQs,
b = .475, p < .001. In other words, in states with low voter turnout, in-state support for the more liberal Democrats was related
to lower state-IQ.
3.3. Discussion
Although conducted at a different level of analysis than Study 1,
Study 2 yielded some support for Hypothesis 1: In states with high
political involvement, there was a linear and positive relationship
between state-IQ and the proportion of Democrats in the state legislature. This ﬁnding represents a conceptual replication of important aspects of Study 1. At the same time, Study 2 also replicated an
unanticipated ﬁnding in Study 1, namely, that some conservative
leanings were related to higher cognitive ability. In Study 2, this
ﬁnding was quite robust, but was conﬁned to states with comparatively low political involvement. Unfortunately, Study 2 did not
allow the examination of different kinds of conservative leanings,
but relied on the proportion of Democratic lawmakers in a state’s
legislatures. Similarly, Study 2 did not permit the examination of
different aspects of cognitive ability; thus, it remains open whether

observed effects were largely driven by verbal ability, as suggested
by Study 1.
4. General discussion
The present studies paint a somewhat complex picture of the
relationship between cognitive ability and political orientation.
There was general support for Adorno et al.’s (1950) notion that
higher conservatism (lower liberalism) was linked to lower cognitive functioning (Hypothesis 1). Yet, the present research also
documents that more conservative attitudes may be associated
with greater ability, especially when, as in Study 1, conservative
attitudes concerned government control (a chief concern in libertarian thought), and in Study 2, when levels of political involvement were low. As such, these studies simultaneously replicate
the inconsistencies of prior research (e.g., Bouchard et al., 2003;
Katz, 2001). While a clear theoretical rationale for a positive relationship between conservatism and cognitive ability may be lacking, it appears, however, that the implicit assumption of earlier
research, that conservative beliefs are inherently less cognitively
demanding than liberal beliefs, is not tenable in light of the present
data.
Hypothesis 3, Sidanius’s (1985) notion that extremists, whether
conservative or liberal, command greater cognitive resources also
garnered a good deal of support. Arguably, in Study 1 this hypothesis received the most support of all three hypotheses because it
held regardless of whether the speciﬁc conservatism-liberalism
variable had a positive or negative relationship with cognitive ability. Conversely, Study 1 shows that an exclusive curvilinear effect
of political ideology on cognitive functioning remains the exception rather than the rule, and that the combination of a linear
and curvilinear effects are typical (cf. Jost et al., 2003b). The fact
that Study 2 did not produce any support for Hypothesis 3 is likely
the result of the different units of analysis in Study 1 and 2, and a
topic to be investigated in future research.
In the present data there was no evidence whatsoever to
support the notion that those on the political fringes have lower
cognitive ability than those with middling views (Hypothesis 2).
Even though this notion regularly emerges in the literature (e.g.,
Greenberg & Jonas, 2003) the continued absence of any conﬁrmatory evidence suggests that it might be time to retire this idea.
Given that this research has established various linkages
between political orientation and cognitive ability, one might wonder which way the causal arrow goes. Excluding the possibility that
a third variable has created the correlation between political orientation and cognitive ability, does one’s cognitive ability shape one’s
political ideology, or do one’s political beliefs have an impact on
one’s level of cognitive ability? Both paths are possible, though it
may be more plausible to view cognitive ability as more basic antecedent to one’s political orientation than the other way around. For
example, documented genetic inﬂuences are more pronounced for
cognitive ability than political orientation (e.g., Neisser et al.,
1996). However, as alluded to earlier, the present correlational
data do not allow any ﬁrm conclusion with regard to causality.
A potential criticism of this research concerns the relatively
small effect sizes that especially Study 1 uncovered where standardized regression coefﬁcients rarely exceeded .10 (see Table 2).
While small effect sizes are still theoretically meaningful (Prentice
& Miller, 1992), Study 2 took advantage of using aggregated scores
from literally hundreds of thousands of students whose test scores
contributed to McDaniel’s (2006a) state-IQ scores, as well as party
membership in a state’s lawmakers, which is also the product of an
aggregation process across thousands, if not millions, of voters. The
‘‘miracle of aggregation” reduces error variance and increases coefﬁcients. As a result, the relevant Study 2 coefﬁcients (simples
slopes) were considerably larger. Nevertheless, one may argue that,

771

at the individual level, the relationship between political orientation and cognitive ability is of small practical signiﬁcance. This is
accurate, but not surprising, given the multitude of factors shaping
political beliefs.
Other criticism of the present work may come from authors
who view work on the psychological correlates of political ideology
as ideologically biased (e.g., Durrheim, 1997; Greenberg & Jonas,
2003). It is sometimes alleged that the nature and choice of the
cognitive variables, typically self-report measures of cognitive
styles, reveal decidedly anti-conservative tendencies. However,
by relying on standardized tests to measure cognitive ability at
the individual (Study 1) and state (Study 2) level, the present research is impervious to this criticism.
In closing, it appears that the practical implications of the present research are not yet entirely clear. For instance, in the highly
functioning student sample of Study 1 conservatism was often
linked to slightly lower verbal ability. Therefore, one might wonder
whether in language-intensive academic disciplines conservative
students are at a disadvantage compared to liberal students.
Kemmelmeier, Danielson, and Basten (2005) concluded that in
many such academic disciplines conservative and liberal students
do equally well. However, to the extent that the type and level of
their cognitive abilities steers individuals toward or away from
certain careers, some of the present ﬁndings might lead one to predict a greater number of liberals in humanistic and other heavily
language-based disciplines. Indeed, Klein and Western (2005)
demonstrated that, in American academia, humanistic disciplines
are more heavily dominated by faculty who support the Democratic Party than is the case for disciplines less heavily based on
language (e.g., natural sciences). Any assumption, however, concerning the implications of conservatism for career choice or success is complicated by the fact that Study 1 provided substantive
evidence for a curvilinear relationship between conservatism and
cognitive ability, and Study 2 highlighted the importance of political involvement. Thus, future research needs to explore how conservatism and its cognitive correlates shape individual outcomes,
within and outside of academia.
