Improved Iteration Complexity Bounds of Cyclic
Block Coordinate Descent for Convex Problems
Ruoyu Sun∗, Mingyi Hong† ‡

Abstract
The iteration complexity of the block-coordinate descent (BCD) type algorithm
has been under extensive investigation. It was recently shown that for convex
problems the classical cyclic BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent) achieves
an O(1/r) complexity (r is the number of passes of all blocks). However, such
bounds are at least linearly depend on K (the number of variable blocks), and
are at least K times worse than those of the gradient descent (GD) and proximal
gradient (PG) methods. In this paper, we close such theoretical performance gap
between cyclic BCD and GD/PG. First we show that for a family of quadratic
nonsmooth problems, the complexity bounds for cyclic Block Coordinate Proximal Gradient (BCPG), a popular variant of BCD, can match those of the GD/PG
in terms of dependency on K (up to a log2 (K) factor). Second, we establish an
improved complexity bound for Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for general
convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our bounds
are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least K times worse than
GD. Our analyses do not depend on the update order of block variables inside
each cycle, thus our results also apply to BCD methods with random permutation
(random sampling without replacement, another popular variant).

1 Introduction
Consider the following convex optimization problem

k=1

where g : X → R is a convex smooth function; h : X → R is a convex lower semi-continuous
possibly nonsmooth function; xk ∈ Xk ⊆ RN is a block variable. A very popular method for
solving this problem is the so-called block coordinate descent (BCD) method [5], where each time
a single block variable is optimized while the rest of the variables remain fixed. Using the classical
cyclic block selection rule, the BCD method can be described below.

The convergence analysis of the BCD has been extensively studied in the literature, see [5, 14,
19, 15, 4, 7, 6, 10, 20]. For example it is known that for smooth problems (i.e. f is continuous
differentiable but possibly nonconvex, h = 0), if each subproblem has a unique solution and g is
non-decreasing in the interval between the current iterate and the minimizer of the subproblem (one
special case is per-block strict convexity), then every limit point of {x(r) } is a stationary point [5,
Proposition 2.7.1]. The authors of [6, 19] have derived relaxed conditions on the convergence of
BCD. In particular, when problem (1) is convex and the level sets are compact, the convergence of
the BCD is guaranteed without requiring the subproblems to have unique solutions [6]. Recently
Razaviyayn et al [15] have shown that the BCD converges if each subproblem (2) is solved inexactly,
by way of optimizing certain surrogate functions.
Luo and Tseng in [10] have shown that when problem (1) satisfies certain additional assumptions
such as having a smooth composite objective and a polyhedral feasible set, then BCD converges linearly without requiring the objective to be strongly convex. There are many recent works on showing
iteration complexity for randomized BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent), see [17, 12, 8, 16, 9]
and the references therein. However the results on the classical cyclic BCD is rather scant. Saha
and Tewari [18] show that the cyclic BCD achieves sublinear convergence for a family of special
LASSO problems. Nutini et al [13] show that when the problem is strongly convex, unconstrained
and smooth, BCGD with certain Gauss-Southwell block selection rule could be faster than the randomized rule. Recently Beck and Tetruashvili show that cyclic BCGD converges sublinearly if the
objective is smooth. Subsequently Hong et al in [7] show that such sublinear rate not only can
be extended to problems with nonsmooth objective, but is true for a large family of BCD-type algorithm (with or without per-block exact minimization, which includes BCGD as a special case).
When each block is minimized exactly and when there is no per-block strong convexity, Beck [2]
proves the sublinear convergence for certain 2-block convex problem (with only one block having
Lipschitzian gradient). It is worth mentioning that all the above results on cyclic BCD can be used
to prove the complexity for a popular randomly permuted BCD in which the blocks are randomly
sampled without replacement.
To illustrate the rates developed for the cyclic BCD algorithm, let us define X ∗ to be the optimal
solution set for problem (1), and define the constant

Let us assume that hk (xk ) ≡ 0, Xk = RN , ∀ k for now, and assume that g(·) has Lipschitz
continuous gradient:
∇g(x) − ∇g(z) ≤ Lx − z, ∀ x, z ∈ X.

(4)

Also assume that g(·, x−k ) has Lipschitz continuous gradient with respect to each xk , i.e.,
∇k g(xk , x−k ) − ∇k g(vk , x−k ) ≤ Lk xk − vk , ∀ x, v ∈ X, ∀ k.

Let Lmax := maxk Lk and Lmin := mink Lk . It is known that the cyclic BCPG has the following

for cyclic BCD in [7, Theorem 6.1]. In contrast, it is well known that when applying the classical

Note that unlike (6), here the constant in front of the 1/(r + 4) term is independent of the problem
dimension. In fact, the ratio of the bound given in (6) and (7) is
r+4
CLmax

which is at least in the order of K. For big data related problems with over millions of variables, a
multiplicative constant in the order of K can be a serious issue. In a recent work by Saha and Tewari
[18], the authors show that for a LASSO problem with special data matrix, the rate of cyclic BCD
(with special initialization) is indeed K-independent. Unfortunately, such a result has not yet been
extended to any other convex problems. An open question posed by a few authors [4, 3, 18] are: is
such a K factor gap intrinsic to the cyclic BCD or merely an artifact of the existing analysis?

2 Improved Bounds of Cyclic BCPG for Nonsmooth Quadratic Problem

where Ak ∈ RM×N ; b ∈ RM ; xk ∈ RN is the kth block coordinate; hk (·) is the same as in
(1). Note the blocks are assumed to have equal dimension for simplicity of presentation. Define
A := [A1 , · · · , Ak ] ∈ RM×KN . For simplicity, we have assumed that all the blocks have the same
size. Problem (8) includes for example LASSO and group LASSO as special cases.
We consider the following cyclic BCPG algorithm.

Define Pmax := maxk Pk and Pmin = mink Pk . Note that for the least square problem (smooth
quadratic minimization, i.e. hk ≡ 0, ∀ k), BCPG reduces to the widely used BCGD method.

In what follows we show that the cyclic BCPG for problem (8) achieves a complexity bound that
only dependents on log2 (N K), and apart from such log factor it is at least K times better than those
known in the literature. Our analysis consists of the following three main steps:
1. Estimate the descent of the objective after each BCPG iteration;
2. Estimate the cost yet to be minimized (cost-to-go) after each BCPG iteration;
3. Combine the above two estimates to obtain the final bound.
First we show that the BCPG achieves the sufficient descent.

Next let us estimate the cost-to-go.

(14)

Our third step combines the previous two steps and characterizes the iteration complexity. This is
the main result of this section.
Theorem 2.1. The iteration complexity of using BCPG to solve (8) is given below.
1. When the stepsizes are chosen conservatively as Pk = L, ∀ k, we have


Δ(r+1) ≤ 3 max Δ0 , 4 log2 (2N K)L

We comment on the bounds derived in the above theorem. The bound for BCPG with uniform
“conservative” stepsize 1/L has the same order as the GD method, except for the log2 (2N K) factor
(cf. (7)). In [4, Corollary 3.2], it is shown that the BCGD with the same “conservative” stepsize
achieves a sublinear rate with a constant of 4L(1 + K)R02 , which is about K/(3 log2 (2N K)) times
worse than our bound. Further, our bound has the same dependency on L (i.e., 12L v.s. L/2) as
the one derived in [18] for BCPG with a “conservative” stepsize to solve an 1 penalized quadratic
problem with special data matrix, but our bound holds true for a much larger class of problems (i.e.,
all quadratic nonsmooth problem in the form of (8)). However, in practice such conservative stepsize
is slow (compared with BCPG with Pk = Lk , for all k) hence is rarely used.
The rest of the bounds derived in Theorem 2.1 is again at least K/ log2 (2N K) times better than
existing bounds of cyclic BCPG. For example, when the problem is smooth and unconstrained, the
ratio between our bound (17) and the bound (6) is given by
6 log2 (2N K)(1 + L2 /(LminLmax ))
6R02 log2 (2N K)(L2 /Lmin + Lmax )
≤
= O(log2 (2N K)/K)
2
2
2
CLmax (1 + KL /Lmin)R0
C(1 + KL2 /L2min)
(18)
where in the last inequality we have used the fact that Lmax /Lmin ≥ 1.
For unconstrained smooth problems, let us compare the bound derived in the second part of Theorem 2.1 (stepsize Pk = Lk , ∀k) with that of the GD (7). If L = KLk for all k (problem badly
conditioned), our bound is about K log2 (2N K) times worse than that of the GD. This indicates a
counter-intuitive phenomenon: by choosing conservative stepsize Pk = L, ∀k the iteration complexity of BCGD is K times better compared with choosing a more aggressive stepzise Pk = Lk , ∀k. It
also indicates that the factor L/Lmin may hide an additional factor of K.

3 Iteration Complexity for General Convex Problems
In this section, we consider improved iteration complexity bounds of BCD for general unconstrained
smooth convex problems. We prove a general iteration complexity result, which includes a result of
Beck et al. [4] as a special case. Our analysis for the general case also applies to smooth quadratic
problems, but is very different from the analysis in previous sections for quadratic problems. For
simplicity, we only consider the case N = 1 (scalar blocks); the generalization to the case N > 1 is
left as future work.

Let us assume that the smooth objective g has second order derivatives Hij (x) := ∂x∂i ∂x
j
When each
block is just a coordinate, we assume |Hij (x)| ≤ Lij , ∀i, j. Then Li = Lii and
√
Lij ≤ Li Lj . For unconstrained smooth convex problems with scalar block variables, the BCPG
iteration reduces to the following coordinate gradient descent (CGD) iteration:

wk+1 means that wk+1 is a linear combination of wk and
where dk = ∇k g(wk ) and wk −→
dk ek (ek is the k-th block unit vector).

In the following theorem, we provide an iteration complexity bound for the general convex problem.
The proof framework follows the standard three-step approach that combines sufficient descent and
cost-to-go estimate; nevertheless, the analysis of the sufficient descent is very different from the
methods used in the previous sections. The intuition is that CGD can be viewed as an inexact
gradient descent method, thus the amount of descent can be bounded in terms of the norm of the full
gradient. It would be difficult to further tighten this bound if the goal is to obtain a sufficient descent
based on the norm of the full gradient. Having established the sufficient descent in terms of the
full gradient ∇g(x(r) ), we can easily prove the iteration complexity result, following the standard
analysis of GD (see, e.g. [11, Theorem 2.1.13]).

improve KL to min{KL , ( k Lk ) }. Neither
 of the two bounds KL and ( k Lk ) implies
the other: when L = Lk , ∀k the new bound ( k Lk )2 is K times larger; when L = KLk , ∀k or
L = L1 > L2 = · · · = LK = 0 the new bound is K times smaller. In fact, when L = KLk , ∀k,
our new bound is K times better than the bound in [4] for either Pk = Lk or Pk = L. For example,
bound is O( Lr ), which matches GD
when Pk = L, ∀k, the bound in [4] becomes O( KL
r ), while our 
(listed in Table 1 below). Another advantage of the new bound ( k Lk )2 is that it does not increase
if we add an artificial block xK+1 and perform CGD for function g̃(x, xk+1 ) = g(x); in contrast,
the existing bound KL2 will increase to (K + 1)L2 , even though the algorithm does not change at
all.
We have demonstrated that our bound can match GD in some cases, but can possibly be K times
worse than GD. An interesting question is: for general convex problems can we obtain an O( Lr )
bound for cyclic BCGD, matching the bound of GD? Removing the K-factor in (32) will lead to an
O( Lr ) bound for conservative stepsize Pk = L no matter how large Lk and L are. We conjecture that
an O( Lr ) bound for cyclic BCGD cannot be achieved for general convex problems. That being said,
we point out that the iteration complexity of cyclic BCGD may depend on other intrinsic parameters
of the problem such as {Lk }k and, possibly, third order derivatives of g. Thus the question of finding
the best iteration complexity bound of the form O(h(K) Lr ), where h(K) is a function of K, may
not be the right question to ask for BCD type algorithms.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we provide new analysis and improved complexity bounds for cyclic BCD-type methods. For convex quadratic problems, we show that the bounds are O( Lr ), which is independent of
K (except for a mild log2 (2K) factor) and is about Lmax /L + L/Lmin times worse than those
for GD/PG. By a simple example we show that it is not possible to obtain an iteration complexity
O(L/(Kr)) for cyclic BCPG. For illustration, the main results of this paper in several simple settings are summarized in the table below. Note that different ratios of L over Lk can lead to quite
different comparison.
