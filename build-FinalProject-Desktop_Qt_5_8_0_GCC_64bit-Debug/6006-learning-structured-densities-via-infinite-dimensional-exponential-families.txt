Abstract
Learning the structure of a probabilistic graphical models is a well studied problem in the machine learning community due to its importance in many applications. Current approaches are mainly focused on learning the structure under restrictive parametric assumptions, which limits the applicability of these methods.
In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the structure of a probabilistic
graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. We consider
probabilities that are members of an infinite dimensional exponential family [4],
which is parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and its
kernel k. One difficulty in learning nonparametric densities is the evaluation of
the normalizing constant. In order to avoid this issue, our procedure minimizes
the penalized score matching objective [10, 11]. We show how to efficiently minimize the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers. Furthermore, we
prove that our procedure recovers the graph structure with high-probability under
mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate ability of our procedure to recover
the true graph structure without the knowledge of the data generating process.

Introduction

Undirected graphical models, or Markov random fields [13], have been extensively studied and applied in fields ranging from computational biology [15, 28], to natural language processing [16, 20]
and computer vision [9, 17]. In an undirected graphical model, conditional independence assumptions underlying a probability distribution are encoded in the graph structure. Furthermore, the joint
probability density function can be factorized according to the cliques of the graph [14]. One of the
fundamental problems in the literature is learning the structure of a graphical model given an i.i.d.
sample from an unknown distribution. A lot of work has been done under specific parametric assumptions on the unknown distribution. For example, in Gaussian Graphical Models the structure of
the graph is encoded by the sparsity pattern of the precision matrix [6, 30]. Similarly, in the context
of exponential family graphical models, where the node conditional distribution given all the other
nodes is a member of an exponential family, the structure is described by the non-zero coefficients
[29]. Most existing approaches to learn the structure of a high-dimensional undirected graphical
model are based on minimizing a penalized loss objective, where the loss is usually a log-likelihood
or a composite likelihood and the penalty induces sparsity on the resulting parameter vector [see,
for example, 6, 12, 18, 22, 24, 29, 30]. In addition to sparsity inducing penalties, methods that
use other structural constraints have been proposed. For example, since many real-world networks
are scale-free [1], several algorithms are designed specifically to learn structure of such networks
1

[5, 19]. Graphs tend to have cluster structure and learning simultaneously the structure and cluster
assignment has been investigated [2, 27].
In this paper, we focus on learning the structure of a pairwise graphical models without assuming
a parametric class of models. The main challenge in estimating nonparametric graphical models
is computation of the log normalizing constant. To get around this problem, we propose to use
score matching [10, 11] as a divergence, instead of the usual KL divergence, as it does not require
evaluation of the log partition function. The probability density function is estimated by minimizing
the expected distance between the model score function and the data score function, where the score
function is defined as gradient of the corresponding probability density functions. The advantage
of this measure is that the normalization constant is canceled out when computing the distance. In
order to learn the underlying graph structure, we assume that the logarithm of the density is additive
in node-wise and edge-wise potentials and use a sparsity inducing penalty to select non-zero edge
potentials. As we will prove later, our procedure will allow us to consistently estimate the underlying
graph structure.
The rest of paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the notations, background and related
work. Then we formulate our model, establish a representer theorem and present a group lasso
algorithm to optimize the objective. Next we prove that our estimator is consistent by showing that
it can recover the true graph with high probability given sufficient number of samples. Finally the
results for simulated data are presented to demonstrate the correctness of our algorithm empirically.

Background & Related Work
Learning graphical models in exponential families

Let x = (x1 , x2 , ..., xd ) be a d-dimensional random vector from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
It is well known that the conditional independency of two variables given all the others is encoded
in the zero pattern of its precision matrix Ω, that is, xi and xj are conditionally independent given
x−ij if and only if Ωij = 0, where x−ij is the vector of x without xi and xj . A sparse estimate
of Ω can be obtained by maximum-likelihood (joint selection) or pseudo-likelihood (neighborhood
selection) optimization with an added l1 penalty [6, 22, 30]. Given n independent realizations of x
(rows of X ∈ Rn×d ), the penalized maximum-likelihood estimate of the precision matrix can be
obtained as
Ω̂λ = arg min tr(ŜΩ) − log det Ω + λkΩk1 ,
Ω0

where Ŝ = n−1 X T X and λ controls the sparsity level of estimated graph.

The pseudo-likelihood method estimates the neighborhood of a node a by the non-zeros of the
solution to a regularized linear model
1
θ̂s = arg min kXs − X−s θk22 + λkθk1 .
(2)
θ n
The estimated neighborhood is then N̂ (s) = {a : θsa 6= 0}.
Another way to specify a parametric graphical model is by assuming that each node-conditional
distributions is a part of the exponential family [29]. Specifically, the conditional distribution of xs
given x−s is assumed to be
X
P (xs |x−s ) = exp(
θst xs xt + C(xs ) − D(x−s , θ)),
(3)
t∈N (s)

where C is the base measure, D is the log-normalization constant and N (s) is the neighborhood a the
node s. Similar to (2), the neighborhood of each node can be estimated by minimizing the negative
log-likelihood with l1 penalty on θ. The optimization is tractable when the normalization constant
D can be easily computed based on the model assumption. For example,
P under Poisson graphical
model assumptions for count data, the normalization constant is − exp( t∈N (s) θst xt ). When using
the neighborhood estimation, the graph can be estimated as the union of the neighborhoods of each
node, which leads to consistent graph estimation [22, 29].
2.2

Generalized Exponential Family and RKHS

We say H is a RKHS associated with kernel k : χ × χ → R+ if and only if for each x ∈ χ, the
following two conditions are satisfied: (1) k(·, x) ∈ H and (2) it has reproducing properties such that
f (x) = hf, k(·, x)iH for all f (·) ∈ H, where k is a symmetric and positive semidefinite function.
Denote the RKHS H with kernel k as H(k).
P∞
For any f ∈ H(k), there exists
P∞ a set of xi and αi , such that f (·) = i=1 αi k(·, xi ). Similarly
for any g ∈ H(k), g(·) = j=1 βj k(·, yj ), the inner product of f and g is defined as hf, giH =
qP
P∞
α

k(x

).
Therefore
the

is

=
i
j
i
j
H
i,j αi αj k(xi , xj ). The sumi,j=1
mation is guaranteed to be larger than or equal to zero because the kernel k is positive semidefinite.
We consider the exponential family in infinite dimensions [4], where
P = {pf (x) = ef (x)−A(f ) q0 (x), x ∈ χ; f ∈ F}
and the function space F is defined as
Z
F = {f ∈ H(k) : A(f ) = log ef (x) q0 (x)dx < ∞},
χ

where q0 (x) is the base measure, A(f ) is a generalized normalization constant such that pf (x) is
a valid probability density function, and H is a RKHS [3] associated with kernel k. To see it as
a generalization of the exponential family, we show some examples that can generate useful finite
dimension exponential families:
• Normal: χ = R, k(x, y) = xy + x2 y 2
• Poisson: χ = N ∪ {0}, k(x, y) = xy
• Exponential: χ = R+ , k(x, y) = xy.
For more detailed information, please refer to [4].
When learning structure of a graphical model, we will further impose structural conditions on H(k)
in order ensure that F consists of additive functions.

Score Matching

Score matching is a convenient procedure that allows for estimating a probability density without
computing the normalizing constant [10, 11]. It is based on minimizing Fisher divergence

Z(θ) q(x, θ) the normalization constant Z(θ) cancels out in the gradient computation, which makes
the divergence independent of Z(θ). Since the score matching objective involves the unknown oracle probability density function p0 , it is typically not computable. However, under some mild
conditions which we will discuss in METHODS section, (4) can be rewritten as

Methods
Model Formulation and Assumptions

We assume that the true probability density function p0 is in P. Furthermore, for simplicity we
assume that
X
log p0 (x) = f (x) =
f0,ij (xi , xj ),
i≤j
(i,j)∈S

where f0,ii (xi , xi ) is a node potential and f0,ij (xi , xj ) is an edge potential. The set S denotes the
edge set of the graph. Extensions to models where potentials are defined over larger cliques are
possible. We further assume that f0,ij ∈ Hij (kij ), where Hij is a RKHS with kernel kij . To
simplify the notation, we use f0,ij (x) or kij (·, x) to denote f0,ij (xi , xj ) and kij (·, (xi , xj )). If the
context is clear, we drop the subscript for norm or inner product. Define
X
H(S) = {f =
fij |fij ∈ Hij }
(7)
(i,j)∈S

as a set of functions that decompose as sum of bivariate functions
P on edge set2 S. Note that
H(S) is also (a subset of) a RKHS with the norm kf k2H(S) =
(i,j)∈S kfij kHij and kernel
P
k = (i,j)∈S kij .
P
Let Ω(f ) = kf kH,1 = i≤j kfij kHij . For any edge set S (not necessarily the true edge set), we
P
denote ΩS (fS ) = s∈S kfs kHs as the norm Ω reduced to S. Similarly, denote its dual norm as
Ω∗S [fS ] = maxΩS (gS )≤1 hfS , gS i [25].
Under the assumption that the unknown f0 is additive, the loss function becomes

Intuitively, C can be viewed as a d2 matrix, and the operator at position (ij, ij 0 ) is Cij,ij 0 . For

which intuitively can be treated as a sub matrix of C with rows S and columns S 0 . We will use this
notation intensively in the main theorem and its proof.
Following [26], we make the following assumptions.
A1. Each kij is twice differentiable on χ × χ.

A6. f0 ∈ R(C), which means there exists γ ∈ H, such that f0 = Cγ. f0 is the oracle function.
We will discuss the definition of operator C and Ω∗ in section 4. Compared with [29], A4 can be
interpreted as the dependency condition and the A5 is the incoherence condition, which is a standard
condition for structure learning in high dimensional statistical estimators.

The first part of theorem states our representer theorem, and the second part is obtained by plugging
in (11) to (10). See supplementary material for a detailed proof. Theorem 3.2 provides us with an
efficient way to minimize (8), as it reduced the optimization to a group lasso problem for which
many efficient solvers exist.

That is, the graph is encoded in the sparsity pattern of fˆµ .

Proof Idea: The theorem above is the main theoretical guarantee for our score matching estimator.
We use the “witness” proof framework inspired by [23, 29]. Let f ∗ denote the true density function
and p∗ the probability density function. We first construct a solution fˆS on true edge set S as

and set fˆS c as zero. Using Proposition 4.1, we prove that kfˆS − fS∗ k = Op (n− 4 ). Then we
compute the subgradient on S c and prove that its dual norm is upper bounded by µΩ(f ) by using
assumptions A4, A5 and A6. Therefore we construct a solution that satisfied the optimality condition
and converges in probability to the true graph. Refer to supplementary material for detailed proof.

Experiments

We illustrate performance of our method on two simulations. In our experiments, we use the same
kernel defined as follows:
kx − yk22
k(x, y) = exp(−
) + r(xT y + c)2 ,
(15)
2σ 2
that is, the summation of a Gaussian kernel and a polynomial kernel. We set σ 2 = 1.5, r = 0.1 and
c = 0.5 for all the simulations.
We report the true positive rate vs false positive rate (ROC) curve to measure the performance of
different procedures. Let S be the true edge set, and let Ŝ µ be the estimated graph. The true positive
µ
and Ŝ µ =1|
and S=0|
rate is defined as TPRµ = |S=1|S=1|
, and false positive rate is FPRµ = |Ŝ =1
, where |·|
|S=0|
is the cardinality of the set. The curve is then plotted based on 100 uniformly-sampled regularization
parameters and based on 20 independent runs.
In the first simulation, we apply our algorithm to data sampled from a simple chain graph-based
Gaussian model (see Figure 1 for detail), and compare its performance with glasso [6]. We use the
same sampling method as in [31] to generate the data: we set Ωs = 0.4 for s ∈ S and its diagonal
to a constant such that Ω is positive definite. We set the dimension d to 25 and change the sample
size n ∈ {20, 40, 60, 80, 100} data points.
Except for the low sample size case (n = 20), the performance of our method is comparable with
glasso, without utilizing the fact that the underlying distribution is of a particular parametric form.
Intuitively, to capture the graph structure, the proposed nonparametric method requires more data
because of much weaker assumptions.
To further show the strength of our algorithm, we test it on a nonparanormal (NPN) distribution
([18]). A random vector x = (x1 , . . . , xp ) has a nonparanormal distribution if there exist functions
(f1 , . . . , fp ) such that (f1 (x1 ), . . . , fd (xd )) ∼ N (µ, Σ). When f is monotone and differentiable,
the probability density function is given by

Here the graph structure is still encoded in the sparsity pattern of Ω = Σ−1 , that is, xi ⊥xj |x−i,j if
and only if Ωij = 0 [18].
In our experiments we use the “Symmetric Power Transformation” [18], that is,

(center) and SME (right).
where g0 (t) = sign(t)|t|α , to transform data. For comparison with graph lasso, we first use a
truncation method to Gaussianize the data, and then apply graphical lasso to the transformed data.
See [18, 31] for details. From figure 2, without knowing the underlying data distribution, the score
matching estimator outperforms glasso, and show similar results to nonparanormal when the sample
size is large.

Discussion

In this paper, we have proposed a new procedure for learning the structure of a nonparametric graphical model. Our procedure is based on minimizing a penalized score matching objective, which can
be performed efficiently using existing group lasso solvers. Particularly appealing aspect of our
approach is that it does not require computing the normalization constant. Therefore, our procedure can be applied to a very broad family of infinite dimensional exponential families. We have
established that the procedure provably recovers the true underlying graphical structure with highprobability under mild conditions. In the future, we plan to investigate more efficient algorithms for
solving (10), since it is often the case that Ĉ is well structured and can be efficiently approximated.
