Resistance to Change: Developing an Individual Differences Measure
Shaul Oreg
Cornell University
The Resistance to Change Scale was designed to measure an individual’s dispositional inclination to
resist changes. In Study 1, exploratory analyses indicated 4 reliable factors: Routine Seeking, Emotional
Reaction to Imposed Change, Cognitive Rigidity, and Short-Term Focus. Studies 2, 3, and 4 confirmed
this structure and demonstrated the scale’s convergent and discriminant validities. Studies 5, 6, and 7
demonstrated the concurrent and predictive validities of the scale in 3 distinct contexts. The scale can be
used to account for the individual-difference component of resistance to change and to predict reactions
to specific change.

moving from a well-defined to an ill-defined laboratory task and
from high school to college (Mumford, Baughman, Threlfall, &
Uhlman, 1993).
Judge, Thoresen, Pucik, and Welbourne (1999) linked several
other traits to a work-oriented concept of coping with change. This
was measured with a 12-item scale that tapped employees’ evaluations of a need for changes in the organization, perceptions
regarding their ability to cope with such changes, and their perceptions of themselves as initiators of change. Personality traits
were combined to create two factors: the Positive Self-Concept
factor and the Risk Tolerance factor. The Positive Self-Concept
factor comprises locus of control, generalized self-efficacy, selfesteem, and positive affectivity. Previous research (Judge, Locke,
& Durham, 1997; Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998) has
found this factor to reflect an individual’s core evaluations of the
self and the ability to cope with difficult or stressful situations. The
Risk Tolerance factor comprises openness to experience, tolerance
for ambiguity, and risk aversion. Both factors predicted managers’
coping with change. A similar study by Wanberg and Banas (2000)
reported that self-esteem, optimism, and perceived control—interpreted as measures of psychological resilience—predicted employees’ willingness to accept changes at work.
All these studies used assessment instruments that had been
designed for other purposes and that are only indirectly related to
an individual’s inclination to resist change. In contrast, the present
research was designed to formulate a conception of a generalized
disposition to resist change and to develop an instrument that
would assess this disposition directly. The starting point was a
review of the literature on resistance to change, with particular
attention to sources of resistance that appeared to derive from an
individual’s personality. Six such sources were identified: (a)
reluctance to lose control, (b) cognitive rigidity, (c) lack of psychological resilience, (d) intolerance to the adjustment period
involved in change, (e) preference for low levels of stimulation and
novelty, and (f) reluctance to give up old habits.
1. Reluctance to lose control. Some researchers have emphasized loss of control as the primary cause of resistance (Conner,
1992). Individuals may resist changes because they feel that control over their life situation is taken away from them with changes
that are imposed on them rather than being self-initiated. Organizational studies that advocate employee involvement and participation in organizational decision making (e.g., Coch & French,

Most modern industrial societies value the person who is willing
and able to initiate and respond positively to change, and yet,
organizations that attempt to initiate such changes are often stymied by individuals or groups within the organization who resist
the changes. Often the reasons for the resistance are not far to seek:
The benefits to the organization are not necessarily consonant
with—and are often antithetical to—the interests of the individuals
being asked to make the change (e.g., Coch & French, 1948;
Tichy, 1983; Zaltman & Duncan, 1977; Zander, 1950). Nevertheless, some individuals seem to resist even changes that are consonant with their interests. Who are these people? What are the
personality characteristics that drive such resistances? The research described in this article sought to answer these questions.
In particular, this article describes the development of a scale—
the Resistance to Change Scale— designed to tap an individual’s
tendency to resist or avoid making changes, to devalue change
generally, and to find change aversive across diverse contexts and
types of change. It was anticipated that resistance to change would
be a multidimensional disposition that comprises behavioral, cognitive, and affective components (cf. Piderit, 2000).
Most approaches to resistance to change have focused on situational antecedents (e.g., Coch & French, 1948; Tichy, 1983;
Zander, 1950). Only recently have studies begun to explore concepts that are related to resistance to change from an individual
difference perspective. For example, self-discipline, an orientation
toward creative achievement, and a lack of defensive rigidity were
suggested to reflect people’s adaptability to change on the basis of
their contribution to the maintenance of high performance when

RESISTANCE TO CHANGE SCALE

1948; Sagie & Koslowsky, 2000) as a means of overcoming
resistance to change focus on this source of resistance.
2. Cognitive rigidity. Among researchers who have examined
the cognitive processes underlying people’s responses to organizational change (Bartunek, Lacey, & Wood, 1992; Bartunek &
Moch, 1987; Lau & Woodman, 1995), some have suggested that
the trait of dogmatism (Rokeach, 1960) might predict an individual’s approach to change (Fox, 1999). Dogmatic individuals are
characterized by rigidity and closed-mindedness and therefore
might be less willing and able to adjust to new situations. Although
one empirical study failed to find support for this hypothesis (Lau
& Woodman, 1995), it still seems likely that some form of cognitive rigidity would be implicated in an individual’s resistance to
change.
3. Lack of psychological resilience. Other researchers suggest
that change is a stressor, and therefore resilience should predict an
individual’s ability to cope with change (e.g., Ashforth & Lee,
1990; Judge et al., 1999). As noted above, resilient individuals
were in fact more willing to participate in an organizational change
(Wanberg & Banas, 2000) and exhibited improved coping with
change (Judge et al., 1999). It may also be that less resilient
individuals are more reluctant to make changes because to do so is
to admit that past practices were faulty, and therefore change
entails a loss of face (e.g., Kanter, 1985; Zaltman & Duncan,
1977).
4. Intolerance to the adjustment period involved in change. A
distinct aspect of individuals’ psychological resilience is their
ability to adjust to new situations. Some researchers have suggested that people resist change because it often involves more
work in the short term (Kanter, 1985). New tasks require learning
and adjustment, and it may be that some individuals are more
willing and able to endure this adjustment period. Others who may
support a particular change in principle may still resist it because
of their reluctance to undergo the required adjustment period.
5. Preference for low levels of stimulation and novelty. A
number of studies established a distinction between adaptive individuals, who are best at performing within a well-defined and
familiar framework, and innovators, who are better at finding
novel solutions outside the given framework (Kirton, 1980, 1989).
One study found that innovative individuals generally exhibit a
greater need for novel stimuli (Goldsmith, 1984). It is thus reasonable to expect that people who resist change would exhibit a
weaker need for novelty. In addition, because change often involves an increase in stimulation, those who prefer lower levels of
stimulation may resist change.
6. Reluctance to give up old habits. Several organizational
theorists discuss reluctance to give up old habits as a common
characteristic of resistance to change (e.g., Tichy, 1983; Watson,
1971). Some have explained this reluctance by arguing that “familiarity breeds comfort” (Harrison, 1968; Harrison & Zajonc,
1970). When individuals encounter new stimuli, familiar responses
may be incompatible with the situation, thus producing stress,
which then becomes associated with the new stimulus.
These several sources of resistance to change were used in
Study 1—an exploratory study—to generate initial items for the
Resistance to Change Scale. Studies 2, 3, and 4 follow to describe
the scale’s structure validation and to establish convergent and
discriminant validities. Studies 5, 6, and 7 then establish the
concurrent and predictive validities of the scale.

681

Study 1: Building the Resistance to Change Scale
Method
For each of the sources of resistance mentioned above, 4 –10 items were
generated. In addition, four items were written to tap an individual’s
general attitude toward change (e.g., “generally, change is good,” “I
generally dislike changes”), yielding an initial pool of 48 items. Five
independent reviewers, experienced in the scale-development process, examined the initial item pool to identify ambiguous wording, doublebarreled items, and redundant items. As a result, 6 items were discarded, 2
were rephrased, and 2 new items were generated, reducing the pool to 44.
These were formatted as 6-point Likert scales, which ranged from 1
(strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree).
Sampling was based on the “snowball” method. Volunteers were solicited by the author to participate in the study and were encouraged to recruit
their acquaintances to participate as well. The scale was administered to
102 women, 122 men, and 2 respondents who did not identify their gender.
The respondents’ age ranged from 18 to 67 years (M ⫽ 31, SD ⫽ 13.5).
Fifty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as students.
No significant differences were found in the mean item scores or in the
factor structures of the different groups (i.e., men vs. women, students vs.
nonstudents, and different age groups).

Analyses and Results
Prior to conducting the factor analysis, the interitem correlation
matrix was examined. Any item that correlated at less than .4 with
all other items was deleted from the analyses (Hinkin, 1998).
Eleven items were discarded for this reason.
An exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the data using
a principle components analysis with an oblique rotation.1 After
the successive deletion of items that either did not load significantly on any factor or loaded highly on more than one factor, a
four-factor solution was obtained. These factors were maintained
based on the obtained Scree plot, the Keiser–Guttman criterion,
and the theoretical meaningfulness of the factors. The results of
this analysis are presented in Table 1.
The first factor contained eight items that pertained to the
incorporation of routines into one’s life (e.g., “I prefer having a
stable routine to experiencing changes in my life”). This factor
included items from both the “preference for low levels of stimulation and novelty” and the “reluctance to give up old habits”
dimensions.
The second factor contained six items that reflect emotional
reactions to imposed change (e.g., “When things don’t go according to plans it stresses me out,” “When I am informed of a change
of plans, I tense up a bit”). This factor combined items from the
“psychological resilience” and “reluctance to lose control”
dimensions.
The third factor consisted of four items that reflect a short-term
focus when addressing change (e.g., “Often, I feel a bit uncom1

Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) recommended the use of the principalcomponents extraction method for factor analytic procedures with more
than 20 variables. The oblique rotation was selected because trait dimensions are theoretically expected to correlate with one another. For comparison, the analyses were also conducted using a varimax rotation and the
principle axis extraction method, with both varimax and promax rotations.
Although factors were sometimes ordered differently, these analyses produced equivalent structures.

“When someone pressures me to change something, I tend to resist
it even if I think the change may ultimately benefit me”). The focus
here appears to be on the immediate inconvenience or adverse
effects of the change. The items can be viewed as involving an
irrational component in that they all reflect resistance that arises in
spite of one’s awareness to the potential long-term benefits involved in the change. The items of this factor were originally
generated for the “intolerance for the adjustment involved in
change,” and “reluctance to lose control” categories.
The fourth factor reflected the suggested cognitive rigidity dimension. This factor contained three items that address the ease
and frequency with which individuals change their minds (e.g., “I
don’t change my mind easily”).
The four factors explain just over 57% of the variance. When
five factors were extracted, 62% of the variance was explained, but
the added factor was both statistically and theoretically very similar to the third factor in the four-factor solution just described (r ⫽

Interfactor correlations are presented in Table 2. The fact that
prior to the rotation, all of the items loaded significantly on the first
factor and that the factors are not independent supports the assumption that these are all dimensions of the same trait.

Rigidity subscale, which contained only three items, was marginally acceptable (.68).
To remove redundancy, three items were removed from the
Routine Seeking subscale, and two were removed from the Emotional Reaction subscales. These items did not add substantial
theoretical content to the subscale and were highly correlated with
other items on their subscales. The alpha coefficients of the reduced Routine Seeking and the Emotional Reaction subscales were
.81 and .82, respectively.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to establish the existence of a
disposition to resist change and to reveal its underlying structure.
The analyses yielded a 16-item scale with four factors: (a) Routine
Seeking, (b) Emotional Reaction to Imposed Change, (c) ShortTerm Focus, and (d) Cognitive Rigidity. These factors can be
conceptualized as reflecting behavioral, affective, and cognitive
aspects of resistance to change, respectively.2
The behavioral dimension consists of people’s inclination to
adopt routines. The affective dimension comprises two components: First, the Emotional Reaction factor reflects the amount of
stress and uneasiness the individual experiences when confronted
with change. Second, the extent to which individuals are distracted
by the short-term inconveniences involved in change, such that
they refrain from choosing a rationally valued long-term benefit,
also reflects an affective reaction to change.3 The cognitive dimension is represented by the Cognitive Rigidity factor, which
taps the frequency and ease with which people change their minds.
The existence of moderate-to-high intercorrelations among factors
reflects the existence of a general disposition to resist change.

Studies 2, 3, and 4: Confirming the Factor Structure of
the Resistance to Change Scale and Establishing its
Convergent and Discriminant Validities
The purpose of Studies 2 and 3 was to confirm the factor
structure of the Resistance to Change Scale and to establish its
convergent and discriminant validities (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955).
Study 4 further probed the scale’s discriminant validity by assessing the relationship between resistance to change and cognitive
ability.

Study 2: Validating the Resistance to Change Scale’s
Structure
Because the Cognitive Rigidity subscale obtained in Study 1
contained only three items and yielded only marginally acceptable
reliability, an additional item was written for this dimension:
“Once I’ve come to a conclusion, I’m not likely to change my
mind.” An additional item was also written for the Short-Term
Focus subscale to improve its reliability as well: “I sometimes find
myself avoiding changes that I know will be good for me.”

Method
One hundred ninety-seven employees from three of Cornell University’s
colleges filled out the Resistance to Change Scale. Faculty and staff
members were contacted via e-mail and were asked to fill out an electronic
version of the questionnaire. Sixty-eight percent of respondents were

683

women, 32% were men; 69% were staff employees, 31% were faculty
members. The mean age was 42 years (SD ⫽ 11.5). The response rate was
27%. As in Study 1, there were no significant gender, age, or occupational
differences in mean item scores or in the scale factor structures.

Results and Discussion
In order to validate the scale structure obtained in Study 1, a
confirmatory factor analysis was applied to the data. A secondorder latent factor represented the general resistance to change
disposition, and four first-order latent factors each represented one
of the Resistance to Change facets identified in Study 1. All four
first-order factors loaded significantly on the second-order factor
( p ⬍ .01). Item standardized regression weight estimates are
presented in Table 3. All but one of the items loaded significantly
on their expected factor. This four-factor model presented good fit

[CFI] ⫽ .968, root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA]

The alpha coefficient obtained for the full Resistance to Change
Scale was .87. Subscale alphas were .75 for the routine seeking
facet, .71 for the emotional reaction facet, .71 for the short-term
thinking facet, and .69 for the cognitive rigidity facet.

Study 3: Personality Correlates of the Resistance to
Change Scale and a Reconfirmation of its Structure
Several traits have been linked to a work-oriented construct of
coping with change (Judge et al., 1999). As noted, the various
traits considered in the Judge et al. (1999) study were reduced to
two factors: Risk Tolerance (which comprises tolerance for ambiguity, risk aversion, and openness to experience), and Positive
Self-Concept (which comprises self-esteem, generalized selfefficacy, positive affectivity, and locus of control). Both factors
were related to individuals’ scores on a coping-with-change scale.
On the basis of Judge et al.’s findings, openness to experience,
tolerance for ambiguity and risk aversion were measured in this
study and were expected to yield significant correlations with the
Resistance to Change Scale. Specifically, individuals who are less
open to experiences, who are less tolerant of ambiguity, and who
are more risk-averse are expected to exhibit higher resistance to
change. Generalized self-efficacy, self-esteem, and locus of control were also measured in this study and were expected to present
significant yet weaker correlations with resistance to change because these traits are related to people’s perceptions regarding their
ability to cope in general and not necessarily to their particular
attitude toward change. Because research suggests that dogmatism
is related to employees’ willingness to cooperate with change (e.g.,
Fox, 1999), it, too, was measured in this study and was also
expected to correlate with resistance to change.
2
Although this resembles Piderit’s (2000) tripartite conceptualization of
resistance to change, in our study resistance to change was conceptualized
as a disposition rather than an attitude toward a particular organizational
change.
3
The value of maintaining the distinction between these two affective
factors was tested in Study 2, in which a three-factor model was found to
be of lower fit than the four-factor model.

Estimates for first-order factor loadings on the second-order Resistance to Change factor. b This was the only
nonsignificant loading. The item was not used in subsequent studies. All other loadings were significant at p ⬍
.001.

Considering that several of the Resistance to Change Scale
items were designed to reflect resistance to change that is due to a
preference for low levels of stimulation, Zuckerman’s (1994a;
1968) Sensation-Seeking Scale was expected to show a strong
negative correlation with resistance to change, in particular with
the Resistance to Change routine-seeking dimension. Individuals
who are high on routine seeking are, in a sense, expressing a desire
for low levels of stimulation and would thus be expected to score
low on sensation seeking.
In addition to these traits, it would also be interesting to assess
the relationships between resistance to change and each of the Big
Five (Digman, 1990) personality dimensions. In addition to openness to experience, neuroticism—which is negatively related to
Judge et al.’s (1999) Positive Self-Concept factor—was also hypothesized to correlate with resistance to change. Individuals who
are less stable emotionally (i.e., higher on neuroticism) are expected to have less faith in their abilities to deal with change and
are therefore more likely to feel threatened by it and resist it (see
also Mumford et al., 1993). There is also a reason to believe that
resistance to change would be indirectly related to extraversion.
Both extraverted and sensation-seeking individuals are characterized as dynamic and active, hence extraversion may be related to
resistance to change through its link to sensation seeking. The two
other Big Five dimensions (i.e., conscientiousness and agreeableness) were not expected to correlate with resistance to change.
To summarize, resistance to change was expected to correlate
with tolerance for ambiguity, risk aversion, openness to experience, dogmatism, and sensation seeking. Weaker correlations were

expected with self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, locus of control, neuroticism, and extraversion.

Method
Participants and procedure. One hundred thirty-four undergraduates
who were enrolled in introductory courses in organizational behavior and
human resources management filled out the study’s questionnaires. Students were offered $5 each in return for their participation in the study. Of
the respondents, 54% were women and 46% were men, and the mean age
was 19.5 years (SD ⫽ 1.4). The response rate was 34%.
Measures. Resistance to change was measured using the Resistance to
Change Scale established in the previous two studies. The alpha coefficient
for the scale was .87. Alphas for routine seeking, emotional reaction,
short-term focus, and cognitive rigidity were .74, .75, .74, and .84,
respectively.
Risk aversion was measured using Slovic’s (1972) four-item scale (e.g.,
“I prefer a low-risk/high-security job with a steady salary over a job that
offers high risks and high rewards,” “I view risk on a job as a situation to
be avoided at all costs”). The measure has been used in organizational
research and has exhibited high reliability (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1989;
Judge et al., 1999). Its reliability alpha coefficient in the present study was
.79.
Locus of control was measured using Levenson’s (1981) internality
scale. Like Rotter’s (1966) original scale, this scale measures the extent to
which people believe in their personal control over their own lives (internal
locus of control) versus the belief that external factors are responsible for
the outcomes in one’s life. The Levenson eight-item internality scale has
been shown to overcome some of the problems involved in the use of
Rotter’s scale (e.g., high social desirability; cf. Lefcourt, 1991). The scale’s
alpha was .64.

Dogmatism was measured using the Short-Form Dogmatism Scale developed by Troldahl and Powell (1965). The short form uses 20 items from
Rokeach’s (1960) original scale that have been shown to maintain the
reliability and validity of the measuring instrument. Example items are “In
this complicated world of ours the only way we can know what’s going on
is to rely on leaders or experts who can be trusted” and “My blood boils
whenever a person stubbornly refuses to admit he’s wrong.” The scale’s
alpha coefficient in this study was .79.
Tolerance for ambiguity was assessed using the seven-item Tolerance
for Ambiguity Scale developed by Lorsch and Morse (1974). The scale
includes items such as “A really satisfying life is a life of problems. When
one is solved, one moves on to the next problem” and “It’s satisfying to
know pretty much what is going to happen on the job from day to day.” In
the present study, the scale’s alpha coefficient was .77.
Generalized self-efficacy was measured using Chen, Gully, and Eden’s
(2001) New General Self-Efficacy Scale. In their study, the scale was
shown to have high reliability and higher construct validity in comparison
with previously established general self-efficacy scales. The scale consists
of eight items (e.g., “I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I have
set for myself,” “When facing difficult tasks, I am certain that I will
accomplish them”). The alpha coefficient for the scale in the present study
was .93.
Self-esteem was measured with Rosenberg’s (1965) 10-item scale. The
scale is the most commonly used measure of self-esteem, and considerable
empirical data support its validity (Blascovich & Tomaka, 1991). Example
items include “I feel that I have a number of good qualities” and “I take a
positive attitude toward myself.” The scale’s alpha coefficient obtained in
this study was .90.
Sensation-seeking was measured using the Impulsive Sensation Seeking
Scale (ImpSS) from the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire
(Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, & Teta, 1993). In Zuckerman et al.’s
(1993) study, items concerning the two traits (i.e., impulsivity and sensation seeking) emerged as one factor and was in line with his previous
research on the relationship between the two constructs (Zuckerman,
1994b). Zuckerman concluded that the ImpSS measures the general
sensation-seeking tendency. The scale contains 19 items and uses a true–
false response format. It has good psychometric properties (e.g., high
reliability, zero correlation with social desirability and acquiescence scales)
(Zuckerman, 1994a), and its reliability coefficient (Kuder–Richardson coefficient [KR20]) in the present study was .84.4

The Big Five (openness to experience, neuroticism, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness) were measured with Saucier’s (1994)
Big-Five Mini-Markers. Measurements of extraversion, agreeableness, and
conscientiousness were used in an exploratory manner given that no
specific predictions were raised regarding their relationship with resistance
to change. Saucier’s Mini-Markers consist of 40 adjectives (e.g., creative,
intellectual, rude; eight for each of the Big Five dimensions) in response to
which subjects are asked to indicate how accurately or inaccurately the
adjectives describe them. The response scale is a 9-point Likert scale
running from 1 (extremely inaccurate) to 9 (extremely accurate). Subscale
reliabilities in the present study were .78 for openness to experience, .84 for
agreeableness, .79 for neuroticism, .87 for extraversion, and .84 for
conscientiousness.

Results
Structure validation. First, a confirmatory factor analysis was
applied to the resistance-to-change data to revalidate the scale’s
structure. All first-order latent factors (i.e., subscale factors)
loaded significantly on the second-order latent factor (i.e., the full
Resistance to Change factor) and all items loaded significantly on
their expected factor. The fit of the data to the four-factor model
proposed in Studies 1 and 2 was good, ␹2(104, N ⫽ 134) ⫽

resistance to change. In particular, among the resistance-to-change
facets, sensation seeking and tolerance for ambiguity were most
strongly related to the routine seeking dimension (r ⫽ ⫺.58 and
⫺.56, respectively, p ⬍ .01); risk aversion was similarly related to
both the emotional reaction and the routine seeking dimensions
(r ⫽ .47 and .46, respectively, p ⬍ .01).
Weaker, yet significant, relationships were exhibited between
resistance to change and dogmatism (r ⫽ .28, p ⬍ .01), neuroticism (r ⫽ .28, p ⬍ .01), and openness to experience (r ⫽ ⫺.19,
p ⬍ .05). Neuroticism was most strongly related to the emotional
reaction (r ⫽ .33, p ⬍ .01) and short-term focus (r ⫽ .33, p ⬍ .01)
dimensions. Dogmatism exhibited its highest correlation with the
short-term focus facet (r ⫽ .27, p ⬍ .01), and significant, yet
somewhat lower, correlations with routine-seeking (r ⫽ .22, p ⬍
.05) and cognitive rigidity (r ⫽ .21, p ⬍ .05). Again, as expected,
individuals who were high on dogmatism and neuroticism and who
were low on openness to experience were more likely to score high
on resistance to change.
Except for neuroticism, none of the traits with which resistance
to change was expected to show weaker relationships yielded
significant correlations. However, some of the Resistance to
Change subscales exhibited significant and theoretically meaningful relationships with these traits. Self-esteem exhibited low-tomoderate negative correlations with the Short-Term Focus and
Routine Seeking subscales (r ⫽ ⫺.32 and ⫺.27, respectively, p ⬍
.01).
Both extraversion and generalized self-efficacy exhibited a low
yet significant negative correlation with routine seeking (r ⫽ ⫺.29
and ⫺.26, respectively, p ⬍ .01) and with short-term focus (r ⫽
⫺.22, p ⬍ .01 and r ⫽ ⫺.23, p ⬍ .05). It is interesting to note that
generalized self-efficacy had a low, yet significant positive correlation with the cognitive rigidity facet. This may be explained by
the fact that people who have greater faith in their abilities (i.e.,
high on generalized self-efficacy) are also more likely to rigidly
hold on to their views. In line with this proposition, cognitive
rigidity was the only dimension to exhibit a significant relationship
with the locus of control scale, and this relationship, too, was in the
direction that individuals with an internal locus of control (i.e.,
who have a greater sense of personal control over their lives)
exhibit increased cognitive rigidity.

Discussion
This study provided evidence for the construct validity of the
resistance-to-change construct. As expected, resistance to change

was associated with traits such as sensation seeking, tolerance for
ambiguity, and risk aversion. Anticipated relationships were also
found with openness to experience, dogmatism, neuroticism, and
extraversion. In addition, the fact that correlations were only
moderate and were substantially lower than the scales’ reliabilities
provides evidence for the construct’s discriminant validity (Campbell & Fiske, 1959).
Although study variables were all assessed with the same paperand-pencil method, it is reasonable to assume that the impact of
such a method bias would primarily be to elevate all of the
intervariable correlations. The patterns of relationships would not
have been affected. Moreover, the fact that several variables did
not correlate with resistance to change, in spite of the existence of
a single method for collecting data, goes to further alleviate concerns regarding the impact of a monomethod bias.
The study also reconfirmed the four-factor structure of the scale.
The existence of significant intersubscale correlations and the fact
that all subscale factors load significantly on the second order
general Resistance to Change factor, indicate that the subscales all
represent facets of the same overarching disposition. The fact that
conceptually relevant personality traits exhibit varying correlations
with the different subscales demonstrates the value of maintaining
the distinction between the different facets.

Study 4: Resistance to Change and Cognitive Ability
Method
Cognitive ability was assessed with the Wonderlic Personnel Test (Wonderlic, 1999), which is a well validated and commonly used index of
general cognitive ability. Eighty-nine undergraduates from Cornell University took the Wonderlic Personnel Test and filled out the Resistance to
Change Scale in return for extra credit in a course or a $5 cash reward.
Sixty-two percent of participants were women, 38% were men, and the
mean age was 19.6 years (SD ⫽ .89).

Results and Discussion
Resistance to change alpha coefficients were: .88 for the total
resistance-to-change score and .82, .78, .78, and .78 for the Routine Seeking, Emotional Reaction, Short Term Focus, and Cognitive Rigidity subscales, respectively. Descriptive statistics and
correlations between study variables are presented in Table 5.
A power analysis indicated that the study’s sample size (N ⫽
89) was large enough to identify a correlation of .28 or larger
(Murphy & Myors, 1998). As can be seen in Table 5, neither the

total resistance-to-change score nor any of the subscales were
significantly related to scores on the Wonderlic Personnel Test.
Therefore, any relationship that may exist between resistance-tochange and cognitive ability is likely to be small.

Studies 5, 6, and 7: Establishing the Scale’s Concurrent
and Predictive Validities
The purpose of the following three studies was to assess relationships between individuals’ scores on the Resistance to Change
Scale and their responses to change in a variety of contexts.

Study 5: Predicting Voluntary Change
The setting for this study involved undergraduates at the beginning of the semester shortly after students have had the opportunity
to make changes to their course schedules. It was expected that
respondents who score high on the Resistance to Change Scale
would be less likely to report making changes to their academic
schedules. As further evidence for the validity of the construct,
resistance to change was expected to be the strongest predictor of
schedule changes in comparison with conceptually related traits.

Method
Participants and procedure. Forty-four undergraduates who were enrolled in a variety of psychology courses participated in the study in return
for extra credit toward the fulfillment of course requirements. Seventythree percent of participants were women, 27% were men, and the mean
age was 20 years (SD ⫽ 1.2).
Participants filled out study questionnaires that contained the Resistance
to Change Scale as well as a set of related personality scales. Following
this, respondents were asked to fill out a separate Enrollment Procedures
Questionnaire that contained questions regarding changes they may have
made in their course schedules at the beginning of the semester. Before the
semester begins, most students reserve spaces in classes by preenrolling.5
Once the semester starts, a “changing period” of several weeks begins in
which students may add or drop courses from their schedules. The Enrollment Procedures Questionnaire asked about these additions or deletions of
courses.
Measures. The Resistance to Change Scale and the other personality
measures were the same as those used in Study 3. The Enrollment Procedures Questionnaire asked whether the students had preenrolled for
courses, and if so, whether they had added or dropped any courses from
their schedule during the changing period.

Results and Discussion
Table 6 shows means and standard deviations of study variables
along with correlations between resistance to change and the
schedule change variable and the other personality traits measured
in the study. Resistance to Change Scale reliabilities were as
follows: .81 for the total Resistance to Change score, and .78, .79,
.73, and .81 for the Routine Seeking, Emotional Reaction, ShortTerm Focus, and Cognitive Rigidity subscales, respectively. Because the dependent variable in this study was dichotomous (have
made or have not made schedule changes), logistic regression
analyses were used to determine the relationship between resistance to change and the various personality traits and the change
behavior.

As predicted, respondents who scored high on resistance to
change were less likely to have changed their academic schedules
(B ⫽ ⫺2.645, SE ⫽ 1.164, p ⫽ .02; ⫺2 log likelihood ⫽ 28.940);
␹2(1, N ⫽ 44) ⫽ 7.366, p ⬍ .01. Similar logistic regression
analyses were conducted for the other personality variables in the
study, and none of them approached significance ( p ⬎ .15 for all
variables).
When testing the predictive power of the specific Resistance to
Change subscales, the cognitive rigidity facet showed a significant
improvement over the null model (B ⫽ ⫺1.239, SE ⫽ .626, p ⫽
.05; ⫺2 log likelihood ⫽ 31.433); ␹2(1, N ⫽ 44) ⫽ 4.873, p ⫽ .03,
and the Short-Term Focus subscale showed a marginally significant improvement over the null model (B ⫽ ⫺1.231, SE ⫽.628,
p ⫽ .05; ⫺2 log likelihood ⫽ 31.687); ␹2(1, N ⫽ 44) ⫽ 4.619, p ⫽
.03.
This study provides initial support for the concurrent validity of
the Resistance to Change Scale. Resistance to change was the only
personality trait that significantly predicted students’ choice to
make or not to make changes in their course schedules. Students
who were dispositionally inclined to resist changes were less likely
to report making changes to their schedules. In particular, the
Cognitive Rigidity and Short-Term Focus subscales were the more
relevant among the four subscales for predicting this specific type
of resistance-to-change behavior. This finding implies that the
main factors that lead students to maintain their original schedules
(i.e., those high on resistance to change) were their cognitive
disinclination to change their minds and their focus on the shortterm inconvenience of conducting the change rather than on its
potential long-term benefits (e.g., enjoying a more interesting
course).
Because the change addressed in this study is self-initiated, it
makes sense that the Emotional Reaction to Imposed Change
subscale did not contribute to the predictive power of resistance to
change. Similarly, the change does not involve a change in routines because the course changing period takes place before students have had a chance to grow accustomed to their preenrollment
schedule. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Routine Seeking
subscale was also not a significant predictor.

Study 6: Predicting Resistance to Innovation
The purpose of this study was to test whether the Resistance to
Change Scale could predict people’s resistance to try out new
products. Three years ago, Cornell University introduced to its
faculty members the option of using CourseInfo—a template for
creating course Web sites. Until that time, professors in most of the
school’s colleges either had no course Web sites or they constructed one on their own. CourseInfo offers great versatility in the
creation of Web sites and provides many useful administrative and
interactive communication features that would not be available
otherwise. It was expected that faculty members who are more
resistant to change would be less likely, or take more time, to adopt
this new service. Because, as in Study 5, this study also involves
a voluntary change, one that does not have substantial implications
5
Forty-eight students initially participated in the study; however, four of
them did not preenroll. Therefore, only data from the remaining 44 participants were used in the analyses.

on one’s daily routines, the Emotional Reaction and Routine
Seeking subscales seem less relevant for predicting the particular
outcome of this study (i.e., adopting a new product). Because the
main reason for avoiding the use of CourseInfo appears to be the
hassle involved in learning how to use the new service, the
short-term thinking was expected to be the strongest contributor to
the scale’s predictive power.

Method
Sixty-seven faculty members from eight departments at Cornell University filled out a questionnaire with the Resistance to Change scale and
answered a number of questions regarding their use of course Web sites. Of
these, only 47 faculty members had been at the university for more than 3
years (before the introduction of the CourseInfo service), and therefore
only their responses were included in the analyses. Sixty-two percent of
participants were men, 38% were women, and the average tenure at the
university was 16 years (SD ⫽ 9.5). The response rate was 27%.

Results and Discussion
Resistance to Change Scale reliabilities were as follows: .82 for
the complete scale, .68 for the Routine Seeking subscale, .78 for
the Emotional Reaction subscale, .76 for the Short-Term Thinking
subscale, and .76 for the Cognitive Rigidity subscale. Table 7
presents descriptive statistics and correlations between study
variables.

RESISTANCE TO CHANGE SCALE

When testing the predictive power of the specific Resistance to
Change subscales, as predicted, the Short-Term Thinking subscale
significantly predicted whether professors used CourseInfo (B ⫽
⫺.927, SE ⫽ .429, p ⫽ .03; ⫺2 log likelihood ⫽ 59.754); ␹2(1,
N ⫽ 47) ⫽ 5.381, p ⫽ .02, and the time it took them to try it out
(B ⫽ ⫺.608, SE ⫽ .248, p ⫽ .02). The Cognitive Rigidity subscale
was marginally significant in predicting the amount of time it took
professors to use CourseInfo sites (B ⫽ ⫺.586, SE ⫽ .299, p ⫽ .06).
This study thus provides additional support for the concurrent
validity of the Resistance to Change Scale. Professors who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try out
a new system for designing course Web sites. Among those who
did adopt the new system, higher levels of resistance were associated with a longer wait time before starting to use the system.
The analyses of relationships between Resistance to Change subscales and professors’ product-adoption behavior confirmed that it
would take those who are oriented toward the short-term inconvenience involved in change and who are more cognitively rigid
longer before they would try out a new product, if they would try
it at all.

Study 7: Predicting Reactions to Imposed Change
The previous two studies demonstrated that the Resistance to
Change Scale predicts people’s inclination versus disinclination to
initiate voluntary changes. The purpose of Study 7 was to test the
predictive ability of the Resistance to Change scale in the context
of imposed change. The study involved the office relocation of 98
university staff members, faculty members, and graduate students from one of Cornell University’s colleges. Some moved
to temporary offices, whereas others moved to their permanent
new offices. Those who are dispositionally inclined to resist
changes—as measured by the Resistance to Change Scale—
were expected to react more negatively to the change and report
increased stress and a decreased motivation and ability to work in
light of the office move. Because the move involved a substantial
change in people’s routines and because of its imposed nature, the
Routine Seeking subscale and the two affective subscales (i.e., the
Emotional Reaction and the Short-Term Focus subscales) were
expected to contribute most strongly to the predictive power of the
Resistance to Change Scale.

689

Method
Procedure. The employees and graduate students involved in the move
were asked to fill out questionnaires on two occasions: first, as the move
started to take place—a small number of days before or after relocating to
their new offices—and a second time, 1 month later. At Time 1, the
Resistance to Change Scale was presented first, following which were the
questions about people’s reactions to the office move. At Time 2, the order
of the questionnaires was reversed.
Measures. The Resistance to Change Scale was administered along
with a second questionnaire with questions about people’s affective response to the move, questions about their cognitive evaluation of the move,
and several questions about various aspects of their functioning at work
(see Appendix). A principle axis factor analysis with an oblique rotation
suggested that the questions about functioning fell into three categories:
avoiding work from the office, work effectiveness, and work relationships.
Participants. Forty-eight of those moving filled out questionnaires at
Time 1. Fifteen participants were graduate students, 9 were faculty members, and the remaining 24 were staff employees. Fifty-eight percent were
women, 42% were men, and the average age was 40 years (SD ⫽ 10). The
overall participation rate was 49%. Time 2 involved 43 participants, 20 of
whom also participated at Time 1. Eighteen participants were graduate
students, 10 were faculty members, and 15 were staff employees. Sixtyfive percent of participants were women, 35% were men, and the average
age was 38 years (SD ⫽ 11). The participation rate was 44%.

Results
Scale alpha coefficients at Time 1 were: .91 for the total
resistance-to-change score and .80, .87, .84, and .86 for the Routine Seeking, Emotional Reaction, Short-Term Focus, and Cognitive Rigidity subscales, respectively. At Time 2, the alphas were:
.93 for the total score and .79, .86, .87, and .77 for the four
subscales. The correlation between Time 1 and Time 2 resistanceto-change scores was calculated to form an index of the Scale’s
test–retest reliability, which was .91. Descriptive statistics and
correlations between study variables at Time 1 and Time 2 are
presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.
In a regression analysis, the resistance-to-change score at
Time 1 significantly predicted people’s affective reactions to the

controlling for the move’s destination (permanent vs. temporary
offices). When regressing the move reaction variables onto the
Resistance to Change subscales, all subscales were significant
except for the Cognitive Rigidity subscale. When using the
resistance-to-change score to predict the three work-functioning
subcategories, the resistance-to-change score was significant for
the work effectiveness (B ⫽ .66, SE ⫽ .22, p ⬍ .01) and work
relationships (B ⫽ .55, SE ⫽ .16, p ⬍ .01) categories, but not for
the “Avoiding work from the office” category.
At Time 2, the resistance-to-change score significantly predicted
participants’ work effectiveness (B ⫽ .67, SE ⫽ .31, p ⫽ .04) and
was marginally significant in predicting their work relationships
(B ⫽.49, SE ⫽ .26, p ⫽ .07) but did not predict their affective
reaction to the move. Participants’ work effectiveness (B ⫽ 1.19,
SE ⫽ .33, p ⬍ .01) and work relationships (B ⫽ .93, SE ⫽ .36, p ⫽
.02) at Time 2 were also significantly predicted by the resistanceto-change score at Time 1.
No significant differences were found in the reactions of the
different occupational groups, the different genders, or different
age groups. Although the move’s destination did not predict people’s affective reactions or work functioning at Time 1 or at
Time 2, it was significant at predicting people’s cognitive evaluation of the move. Not surprisingly, employees and students who
moved to their permanent offices tended to view the move more
positively than did those who moved to temporary offices.

Discussion
As expected, the Resistance to Change Scale predicted people’s
affective reactions to the move as well as their functioning at work.
Those who were dispositionally inclined to resist changes were
more distraught by the change and reported an increased difficulty
to work effectively. Evidently, even though resistant individuals’
affective reactions to the change waned over time, they did not
recover from the negative impact of the move on their functioning,
even 1 month after moving. In support to the scale’s predictive
validity across contexts, even among those participants who
moved into permanent new offices and provided a positive cognitive evaluation of the move, high–resistance-to-change individuals
were still more upset about the move and had a more difficult time
maintaining effective functioning, compared with nonresistant
participants.

The fact that the Routine Seeking, Emotional Reaction, and
Short-Term Focus subscales, but not the Cognitive Rigidity subscale, were significant predictors of people’s reactions to the
move, falls in line with the particular nature of the change and
lends further support to the scale’s validity.
Although the collection of data for both the Resistance to
Change Scale and the reactions to the move in the same questionnaire may raise concerns of a monomethod bias, the fact that the
Resistance to Change Scale did not predict participants’ cognitive
evaluation of the move and that not all subscales were significant
at predicting reactions to the move suggests that the findings
reflect genuine, nonartifactual relationships. Even more compelling in alleviating such concerns is the fact that participants’
resistance-to-change score at Time 1 was significant at predicting
their functioning at work 1 month later at Time 2.

General Discussion
The purpose of this project was to establish and validate a scale
for the measurement of individual differences in resistance to
change. The results of seven studies indicate a four-facet structure
to the disposition: (a) routine seeking, (b) emotional reaction to
imposed change, (c) short-term focus, and (d) cognitive rigidity.
The structure was established in the first study and was validated
on two additional, independent samples (in Studies 2 and 3).
Studies 3 and 4 helped establish convergent and discriminant
validities, and Studies 5–7 provided evidence for the scale’s concurrent and predictive validities. In all seven studies, Resistance to
Change and its subscales achieved satisfactory reliabilities.
The fact that the scale, which was not tailored to correspond to
any specific type of change, predicted resistance behavior across a
variety of settings, demonstrates its value in explaining resistances
above and beyond any contextual causes. In addition, the fact that
different Resistance to Change subscales were highlighted in different contexts, in accordance with their theoretical content, further demonstrates the validity of the scale and the breadth of its
relevance.
As noted above, other research has recently advocated the
measurement of traits, such as risk aversion, as predictors of
employees’ reactions to change (e.g., Judge et al., 1999). Contrary
to measures of these traits, the Resistance to Change Scale was
designed to assess directly the dispositional component that con-

RESISTANCE TO CHANGE SCALE

tributes to people’s reactions to change. On a practical level,
assessing the dispositional aspect of resistance to change with the
Resistance to Change Scale would be far more economical than
using a broad range of measures, such as risk aversion, tolerance
for ambiguity, and self-esteem, that each tap into a different aspect
of resistance to change.
The findings described in this article have a number of implications. First, they complement work on the institutional determinants of resistance to change (e.g., Hannan & Freeman, 1984) and
on the psychological processes underlying resistance (e.g., George
& Jones, 2001) by bringing individual differences to this important
domain of organizational behavior. Researchers interested in resistance to change and its interaction with other variables now
have a tool for measuring the dispositional component of resistance. Moreover, by using the Resistance to Change Scale, even
studies that are interested in the more macro, situational predictors
of resistance could enhance their findings by controlling for the
individual differences component.
The Resistance to Change Scale also has potential uses for
personnel selection and training. The scale could be used simply to
select change-resilient employees for those positions or assignments that inherently entail frequent changes. Furthermore, the
scale may also be used to identify employees who could benefit
from a training program in which strategies for coping with the
upcoming change would be taught. Interventions can be designed
and tailored for individual employees in accordance with the
sources of resistance as suggested by the scale (e.g., short-term
focus, emotional reaction to imposed change).
Another field for which the Resistance to Change Scale may be
useful is that of consumer behavior. Consumers’ resistance to try
new products is considered a significant obstacle for most companies that attempt to introduce new products. Similar to the
research on organizational change, the literature on consumer
behavior has mainly considered situational antecedents of customer’s resistance to try new products (e.g., Ram & Sheth, 1989).
Among individual difference variables that have been considered
are consumer demographics (e.g., Dickerson & Gentry, 1983;
LaBay & Kinnear, 1981) or personality traits such as creativity
(Hirschman, 1980) or optimum stimulation level (Raju, 1980) that
were expected to relate to customer resistance to adopt new products. As has been shown in Study 6 in this article, the Resistance
to Change Scale can be successful at predicting such disinclination
to adopt new products.
