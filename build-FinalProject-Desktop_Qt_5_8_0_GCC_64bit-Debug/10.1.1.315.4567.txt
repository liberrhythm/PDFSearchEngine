Self-efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change
Albert Bandura
Stanford University
The present article presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain
and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment.
This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the
level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much
effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively
threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery,
further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive
behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived
from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments,
vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceived selfefficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing
of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive
sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in
terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported
from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that
support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes. Possible directions for further research are discussed.

apparent divergence of theory and practice
can be reconciled by postulating that cognitive processes mediate change but that cognitive events are induced and altered most
readily by experience of mastery arising from
effective performance. The distinction between process and means is underscored, because it is often assumed that a cognitive
mode of operation requires a symbolic means
of induction. Psychological changes can be
produced through other means than performance accomplishments. Therefore, the
explanatory mechanism developed in this
article is designed to account for changes in
behavior resulting from diverse modes of
treatment.

Current developments in the field of behavioral change reflect two major divergent
trends. The difference is especially evident in
the treatment of dysfunctional inhibitions
and defensive behavior. On the one hand, the
mechanisms by which human behavior is
acquired and regulated are increasingly formulated in terms of cognitive processes. On
the other hand, it is performance-based procedures that are proving to be most powerful
for effecting psychological changes. As a consequence, successful performance is replacing
symbolically based experiences as the principle vehicle of change.
The present article presents the view that
changes achieved by different methods derive
from a common cognitive mechanism. The

Psychological treatments based on learning
principles were originally conceptualized to
operate through peripheral mechanisms. New
behavior was presumably shaped automatically by its effects. Contingency learning
through paired stimulation was construed in
191

connectionist terms as a process in which responses were linked directly to stimuli. Altering the rate of preexisting behavior by reinforcement was portrayed as a process
wherein responses were regulated by their
immediate consequences without requiring
any conscious involvement of the responders.
Growing evidence from several lines of research altered theoretical perspectives on how
behavior is acquired and regulated. Theoretical formulations emphasizing peripheral
mechanisms began to give way to cognitively
oriented theories that explained behavior in
terms of central processing of direct, vicarious, and symbolic sources of information.
Detailed analysis of the empirical and conceptual issues (see Bandura, 1977) falls
beyond the scope of the present article. To
summarize briefly, however, it has now been
amply documented that cognitive processes
play a prominent role in the acquisition and
retention of new behavior patterns. Transitory
experiences leave lasting effects by being
coded and retained in symbols for memory
representation. Because acquisition of response information is a major aspect of learning, much human behavior is developed
through modeling. From observing others, one
forms a conception of how new behavior patterns are performed, and on later occasions
the symbolic construction serves as a guide
for action (Bandura, 1971). The initial approximations of response patterns learned
observationally are further refined through
self-corrective adjustments based on informative feedback from performance.
Learning from response consequences is
also conceived of largely as a cognitive
process. Consequences serve as an unarticulated way of informing performers what they
must do to gain beneficial outcomes and to
avoid punishing ones. By observing the differential effects of their own actions, individuals discern which responses are appropriate in which settings and behave accordingly (Dulany, 1968). Viewed from the
cognitive framework, learning from differential outcomes becomes a special case of
observational learning. In this mode of conveying response information, the conception
of the appropriate behavior is gradually con-

structed from observing the effects of one's
actions rather than from the examples provided by others.
Changes in behavior produced by stimuli
that either signify events to come or indicate
probable response consequences also have
been shown to rely heavily on cognitive representations of contingencies. People are not
much affected by paired stimulation unless
they recognize that the events are correlated
(Dawson & Furedy, 1976; Grings, 1973).
Stimuli influence the likelihood of a behavior's being performed by virtue of their
predictive function, not because the stimuli
are automatically connected to responses by
their having occurred together. Reinterpretation of antecedent determinants as predictive
cues, rather than as controlling stimuli, has
shifted the locus of the regulation of behavior from the stimulus to the individual.
The issue of the locus at which behavioral
determinants operate applies to reinforcement influences as well as to antecedent environmental stimuli. Contrary to the common
view that behavior is controlled by its immediate consequences, behavior is related to
its outcomes at the level of aggregate consequences rather than momentary effects
(Baum, 1973). People process and synthesize
feedback information from sequences of
events over long intervals about the situational circumstances and the patterns and
rates of actions that are necessary to produce
given outcomes. Since consequences affect behavior through the influence of thought, beliefs about schedules of reinforcement can
exert greater influence on behavior than the
reinforcement itself (Baron, Kaufman, &
Stauber, 1969; Kaufman, Baron, & Kopp,
1966). Incidence of behavior that has been
positively reinforced does not increase if individuals believe, based on other information,
that the same actions will not be rewarded
on future occasions (Estes, 1972); and the
same consequences can increase, reduce, or
have no effect on incidence of behavior depending on whether individuals are led to
believe that the consequences signify correct
responses, incorrect responses, or occur noncontingently (Dulany, 1968).
The discussion thus far has examined the

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

role of cognition in the acquisition and
regulation of behavior. Motivation, which is
primarily concerned with activation and persistence of behavior, is also partly rooted in
cognitive activities. The capacity to represent future consequences in thought provides
one cognitively based source of motivation.
Through cognitive representation of future outcomes individuals can generate current motivators of behavior. Seen from this perspective, reinforcement operations affect behavior largely by creating expectations that
behaving in a certain way will produce anticipated benefits or avert future difficulties
(Bolles, 1972b). In the enhancement of
previously learned behavior, reinforcement is
conceived of mainly as a motivational device rather than as an automatic response
strengthener.
A second cognitively based source of motivation operates through the intervening influences of goal setting and self-evaluative
reactions (Bandura, 1976b, 1977). Selfmotivation involves standards against which
to evaluate performance. By making selfrewarding reactions conditional on attaining a
certain level of behavior, individuals create
self-inducements to persist in their efforts
until their performances match self-prescribed
standards. Perceived negative discrepancies
between performance and standards create
dissatisfactions that motivate corrective
changes in behavior. Both the anticipated
satisfactions of desired accomplishments and
the negative appraisals of insufficient performance thus provide incentives for action.
Having accomplished a given level of performance, individuals often are no longer
satisfied with it and make further self-reward
contingent on higher attainments.
The reconceptualization of human learning and motivation in terms of cognitive
processes has major implications for the
mechanisms through which therapeutic procedures alter behavioral functioning. Although the advances in cognitive psychology
are a subject of increasing interest in speculations about behavioral change processes,
few new theories of psychotherapy have been
proposed that might prove useful in stimulating research on explanatory mechanisms

and in integrating the results accompanying
diverse modes of treatment. The present
article outlines a theoretical framework, in
which the concept of self-efficacy is assigned
a central role, for analyzing changes achieved
in fearful and avoidant behavior. The explanatory value of this conceptual system
is then evaluated by its ability to predict
behavioral changes produced through different methods of treatment.
Efficacy Expectations as a Mechanism of
Operation
The present theory is based on the principal asssumption that psychological procedures, whatever their form, serve as means
of creating and strengthening expectations
of personal efficacy. Within this analysis,
efficacy expectations are distinguished from
response-outcome expectancies. The difference is presented schematically in Figure 1.
An outcome expectancy is defined as a
person's estimate that a given behavior will
lead to certain outcomes. An efficacy expectation is the conviction that one can
successfully execute the behavior required to
produce the outcomes. Outcome and efficacy
expectations are differentiated, because individuals can believe that a particular course
of action will produce certain outcomes, but
if they entertain serious doubts about whether
they can perform the necessary activities
such information does not influence their
behavior.
In this conceptual system, expectations of
personal mastery affect both initiation and
persistence of coping behavior. The strength
of people's convictions in their own effectiveness is likely to affect whether they will even
try to cope with given situations. At this
initial level, perceived self-efficacy influences

choice of behavioral settings. People fear and
tend to avoid threatening situations they
believe exceed their coping skills, whereas
they get involved in activities and behave
assuredly when they judge themselves capable of handling situations that would otherwise be intimidating.
Not only can perceived self-efficacy have
directive influence on choice of activities
and settings, but, through expectations of
eventual success, it can affect coping efforts
once they are initiated. Efficacy expectations
determine how much effort people will expend and how long they will persist in the
face of obstacles and aversive experiences.
The stronger the perceived self-efficacy, the
more active the efforts. Those who persist in
subjectively threatening activities that are
in fact relatively safe will gain corrective
experiences that reinforce their sense of
efficacy, thereby eventually eliminating their
defensive behavior. Those who cease their coping efforts prematurely will retain their selfdebilitating expectations and fears for a long
time.
The preceding analysis of how perceived
self-efficacy influences performance is not
meant to imply that expectation is the sole
determinant of behavior. Expectation alone
will not produce desired performance if the
component capabilities are lacking. Moreover,
there are many things that people can do
with certainty of success that they do not
perform because they have no incentives
to do so. Given appropriate skills and adequate incentives, however, efficacy expectations are a major determinant of people's
choice of activities, how much effort they will
expend, and of how long they will sustain
effort in dealing with stressful situations.
Dimensions of Efficacy

Expectations

Empirical tests of the relationship between
expectancy and performance of threatening
activities have been hampered by inadequacy
of the expectancy analysis. In most studies
the measures of expectations are mainly concerned with people's hopes for favorable outcomes rather than with their sense of per-

sonal mastery. Moreover, expectations are
usually assessed globally only at a single
point in a change process as though they
represent a static, unidimensional factor.
Participants in experiments of this type are
simply asked to judge how much they expect
to benefit from a given procedure. When
asked to make such estimates, participants
assume, more often than not, that the benefits
will be produced by the external ministrations rather than gained through the development of self-efficacy. Such global measures reflect a mixture of, among other things,
hope, wishful thinking, belief in the potency
of the procedures, and faith in the therapist.
It therefore comes as no surprise that outcome expectations of this type have little
relation to magnitude of behavioral change
(Davison & Wilson, 1973, Lick & Bootzin,
1975).
Efficacy expectations vary on several dimensions that have important performance
implications. They differ in magnitude. Thus
when tasks are ordered in level of difficulty,
the efficacy expectations of different individuals may be limited to the simpler tasks, extend to moderately difficult ones, or include
even the most taxing performances. Efficacy
expectations also differ in generality. Some
experiences create circumscribed mastery expectations. Others instill a more generalized
sense of efficacy that extends well beyond the
specific treatment situation. In addition,
expectancies vary in strength. Weak expectations are easily extinguishable by disconfirming experiences, whereas individuals who
possess strong expectations of mastery will
persevere in their coping efforts despite disconfirming experiences.
An adequate expectancy analysis, therefore, requires detailed assessment of the
magnitude, generality, and strength of efficacy expectations commensurate with the
precision with which behavioral processes are
measured. Both efficacy expectations and performance should be assessed at significant
junctures in the change process to clarify
their reciprocal effects on each other. Mastery
expectations influence performance and are,
in turn, altered by the cumulative effects of
one's efforts.

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

Sources of Efficacy

Expectations

In this social learning analysis, expectations of personal efficacy are based on four
major sources of information: performance
accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal
persuasion, and physiological states. Figure 2
presents the diverse influence procedures
commonly used to reduce defensive behavior
and presents the principal source through
which each treatment operates to create
expectations of mastery. Any given method,
depending on how it is applied, may of
course draw to a lesser extent on one or more
other sources of efficacy information. For example, as we shall see shortly, performancebased treatments not only promote behavioral accomplishments but also extinguish
fear arousal, thus authenticating self-efficacy
through enactive and arousal sources of information. Other methods, however, provide
fewer ways of acquiring information about
one's capability for coping with threatening
situations. By postulating a common mechanism of operation, this analysis provides a
conceptual framework within which to study
behavioral changes achieved by different
modes of treatment.
Performance accomplishments. This source
of efficacy information is especially influential

because it is based on personal mastery experiences. Successes raise mastery expectations; repeated failures lower them, particularly if the mishaps occur early in the
course of events. After strong efficacy expectations are developed through repeated
success, the negative impact of occasional
failures is likely to be reduced. Indeed, occasional failures that are later overcome by
determined effort can strengthen self-motivated persistence if one finds through experience that even the most difficult obstacles can be mastered by sustained effort.
The effects of failure on personal efficacy
therefore partly depend on the timing and
the total pattern of experiences in which the
failures occur.
Once established, enhanced self-efficacy tends
to generalize to other situations in which
performance was self-debilitated by preoccupation with personal inadequacies (Bandura, Adams, & Beyer, in press; Bandura,
Jeffery, & Gajdos, 1975). As a result, improvements in behavioral functioning transfer
not only to similar situations but to activities
that are substantially different from those on
which the treatment was focused. Thus, for
example, increased self-efficacy gained through
rapid mastery of a specific animal phobia can

increase coping efforts in social situations
as well as reduce fears of other animals.
However, the generalization effects occur
most predictably to the activities that are
most similar to those in which self-efficacy
was restored by treatment (Bandura, Blanchard, & Ritter, 1969).
Methods of change that operate on the
basis of performance accomplishments convey
efficacy information in more ways than simply
through the evidence of performance improvements. In the course of treatments employing modeling with guided performance,
participants acquire a generalizable skill for
dealing successfully with stressful situations,
a skill that they use to overcome a variety of
dysfunctional fears and inhibitions in their everyday life (Bandura et al., in press; Bandura
et al., 1975). Having a serviceable coping
skill at one's disposal undoubtedly contributes
to one's sense of personal efficacy. Behavioral
capabilities can also be enhanced through
modeling alone (Bandura, 1971; Flanders,
1968). However, participant modeling provides additional opportunities for translating
behavioral conceptions to appropriate actions
and for making corrective refinements toward
the perfection of skills.
Most of the treatment procedures developed in recent years to eliminate fearful
and defensive behavior have been implemented either through performance or by
symbolic procedures. Regardless of the
methods involved, results of comparative
studies attest to the superiority of performance-based treatments. In the desensitization
approach devised by Wolpe (1974), clients
receive graduated exposure to aversive events
in conjunction with anxiety reducing activities, usually in the form of muscular
relaxation. A number of experiments have
been reported in which relaxation is paired
with scenes in which phobics visualize
themselves engaging in progressively more
threatening activities or with enactment of
the same hierarchy of activities with the
actual threats. Findings based on different
types of phobias consistently reveal that
performance desensitization produces substantially greater behavioral change than does
symbolic desensitization (LoPicollo, 1970;

Sherman, 1972; Strahley, 1966). Physiological measures yield similar results. Symbolic
desensitization reduces autonomic responses
to imagined but not to actual threats, whereas
performance desensitization eliminates autonomic responses to both imagined and actual
threats (Barlow, Leitenberg, Agras, & Wincze,
1969). The substantial benefits of successful
performance are typically achieved in less
time than is required to extinguish arousal to
symbolic representations of threats.
More recently, avoidance behavior has
been treated by procedures involving massive
exposure to aversive events. In this approach,
intense anxiety is elicited by prolonged exposure to the most threatening situations
and sustained at high levels, without relief,
until emotional reactions are extinguished.
Several investigators have compared the
relative success of prolonged exposure to
aversive situations in imagery and actual encounters with them in ameliorating chronic
agoraphobias. Real encounters with threats
produce results decidely superior to imagined
exposure, which has weak, variable effects
(Emmelkamp & Wessels, 1975; Stern &
Marks, 1973; Watson, Mullett, & Pillay,
1973). Prolonged encounters that ensure behavioral improvements are more effective
than distributed brief encounters that are
likely to end before successful performance
of the activity is achieved (Rabavilas,
Boulougouris, & Stefanis, 1976).
The participant modeling approach to the
elimination of defensive behavior utilizes
successful performance as the primary vehicle
of psychological change. People displaying
intractable fears and inhibitions are not
about to do what they dread. In implementing participant modeling, therapists therefore
structure the environment so that clients can
perform successfully despite their incapacities. This is achieved by enlisting a variety of
response induction aids, including preliminary
modeling of threatening activities, graduated
tasks, enactment over graduated temporal
intervals, joint performance with the therapist, protective aids to.reduce the likelihood
of feared consequences, and variation in the
severity of the threat itself (Bandura, Jeffery,
& Wright, 1974). As treatment progresses,

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

the supplementary aids are withdrawn so
that clients cope effectively unassisted. Selfdirected mastery experiences are then arranged to reinforce a sense of personal efficacy. Through this form of treatment incapacitated people rapidly lose their fears,
they are able to engage in activities they
formerly inhibited, and they display generalized reductions of fears toward threats
beyond the specifically treated conditions
(Bandura, 1976a).
Participant modeling has been compared
with various symbolically based treatments.
These studies corroborate the superiority of
successful performance facilitated by modeling as compared to vicarious experience alone
(Bandura et al., 1969; Blanchard, 1970b;
Lewis, 1974; Ritter, 1969; Roper, Rachman,
& Marks, 1975), to symbolic desensitization
(Bandura et al., 1969; Litvak, 1969), and
to imaginal modeling in which clients visualize themselves or others coping successfully
with threats (Thase & Moss, 1976). When
participant modeling is subsequently administered to those who benefit only partially from the symbolic procedures, avoidance behavior is thoroughly eliminated within
a brief period.
The findings summarized above are consistent with self-efficacy theory, but they do
not shed much light on the mechanism by
which specific mastery experiences produce
generalized and enduring changes in behavior.
Verification of the operative mechanism requires experimental evidence that experienced
mastery does in fact alter the level and
strength of self-efficacy and that self-efficacy
is, in turn, linked to behavior. We shall return later to research that addresses itself
specifically to the linkages between treatment procedures, perceived self-efficacy, and
behavior.
Vicarious experience. People do not rely on
experienced mastery as the sole source of information concerning their level of selfefficacy. Many expectations are derived from
vicarious experience. Seeing others perform
threatening activities without adverse consequences can generate expectations in observers that they too will improve if they
intensify and persist in their efforts. They

197

persuade themselves that if others can do it,
they should be able to achieve at least some
improvement in performance (Bandura &
Barab, 1973). Vicarious experience, relying
as it does on inferences from social comparison, is a less dependable source of information about one's capabilities than is
direct evidence of personal accomplishments.
Consequently, the efficacy expectations induced by modeling alone are likely to be
weaker and more vulnerable to change.
A number of modeling variables that are
apt to affect expectations of personal efficacy
have been shown to enhance the disinhibiting
influence of modeling procedures. Phobics
benefit more from seeing models overcome
their difficulties by determined effort than
from observing facile performances by adept
models (Kazdin, 1973; Meichenbaum, 1971).
Showing the gains achieved by effortful
coping behavior not only minimizes for observers the negative impact of temporary
distress but demonstrates that even the most
anxious can eventually succeed through perseverance. Similarity to the model in other
characteristics, which increases the personal
relevance of vicariously derived information,
can likewise enhance the effectiveness of
symbolic modeling (Kazdin, 1974b).
Modeled behavior with clear outcomes
conveys more efficacy information than if the
effects of the modeled actions remain ambiguous. In investigations of vicarious processes, observing one perform activities that
meet with success does, indeed, produce
greater behavioral improvements than witnessing the same performances modeled without any evident consequences (Kazdin, 1974c,
1975). Diversified modeling, in which the
activities observers regard as hazardous are
repeatedly shown to be safe by a variety of
models, is superior to exposure to the same
performances by a single model (Bandura &
Menlove, 1968; Kazdin, 1974a, 1975, 1976).
If people of widely differing characteristics
can succeed, then observers have a reasonable basis for increasing their own sense of
self-efficacy.
The pattern of results reported above offers at least suggestive support for the view
that exemplifications of success through sus-

198

ALBERT BANDURA

tained effort with substantiating comparative
information can enhance observers' perceptions of their own performance capabilities.
Research will be presented below that bears
more directly on the proposition that modeling procedures alter avoidance behavior
through the intervening influence of efficacy
expectations.
Verbal persuasion. In attempts to influence
human behavior, verbal persuasion is widely
used because of its ease and ready availability. People are led, through suggestion,
into believing they can cope successfully with
what has overwhelmed them in the past.
Efficacy expectations induced in this manner
are also likely to be weaker than those arising
from one's own accomplishments because
they do not provide an authentic experiential
base for them. In the face of distressing
threats and a long history of failure in coping
with them, whatever mastery expectations
are induced by suggestion can be readily
extinguished by disconfirming experiences.
Results of several lines of research attest
to the limitation of procedures that attempt
to instill outcome expectations in people
simply by telling them what to expect. In
laboratory studies, "placebo" conditions designed suggestively to raise expectations of
improvement produce little change in refractory behavior (Lick & Bootzin, 1975;
Moore, 1965; Paul, 1966). Whether this is
due to the low credibility of the suggestions
or to the weakness of the induced expectations cannot be determined from these studies, because the expectations were not
measured.
Numerous experiments have been conducted in which phobics receive desensitization treatment without any expectancy information or with suggestions that it is either
highly efficacious or ineffective. The differential outcome expectations are verbally induced prior to, during, or immediately after
treatment in the various studies. The findings
generally show that desensitization reduces
phobic behavior, but the outcome expectancy
manipulations have either no effect or weak,
inconsistent ones (Hewlett & Nawas, 1971;
McGlynn & Mapp, 1970; McGlynn, Mealiea,
& Nawas, 1969; McGlynn, Reynolds, &

Linder, 1971). As in the "placebo" studies, it
is difficult to make conclusive interpretations
because the outcome expectations induced
suggestively are not measured prior to the
assessment of behavior changes, if at all.
Simply informing participants that they will
or will not benefit from treatment does not
mean that they necessarily believe what they
are told, especially when it contradicts their
other personal experiences. Moreover, in the
studies just cited the verbal influence is
aimed mainly at raising outcome expectations
rather than at enhancing self-efficacy. It is
changes on the latter dimension that are
most relevant to the theory under discussion.
Although social persuasion alone may have
definite limitations as a means of creating an
enduring sense of personal efficacy, it can
contribute to the successes achieved through
corrective performance. That is, people who
are socially persuaded that they possess the
capabilities to master difficult situations and
are provided with provisional aids for effective action are likely to mobilize greater
effort than those who receive only the performance aids. However, to raise by persuasion expectations of personal competence
without arranging conditions to facilitate effective performance will most likely lead to
failures that discredit the persuaders and
further undermine the recipients' perceived
self-efficacy. It is therefore the interactive, as
well as the independent, effects of social
persuasion on self-efficacy that merit experimental consideration.
Emotional arousal. Stressful and taxing
situations generally elicit emotional arousal
that, depending on the circumstances, might
have informative value concerning personal
competency. Therefore, emotional arousal is
another constituent source of information
that can affect perceived self-efficacy in coping with threatening situations. People rely
partly on their state of physiological arousal
in judging their anxiety and vulnerability to
stress. Because high arousal usually debilitates performance, individuals are more likely
to expect success when they are not beset
by aversive arousal than if they are tense
and viscerally agitated. Fear reactions gen-

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

erate further fear of impending stressful
situations through anticipatory self-arousal.
By conjuring up fear-provoking thoughts
about their ineptitude, individuals can rouse
themselves to elevated levels of anxiety that
far exceed the fear experienced during the
actual threatening situation.
As will be recalled from the earlier discussion, desensitization and massive exposure
treatments aimed at extinguishing anxiety
arousal produce some reductions in avoidance
behavior. Anxiety arousal to threats is likewise diminished by modeling, and is even
more thoroughly eliminated by experienced
mastery achieved through participant modeling (Bandura & Barab, 1973; Bandura et
al., 1969; Blanchard, 1970a). Modeling approaches have other advantages for enhancing
self-efficacy and thereby removing dysfunctional fears. In addition to diminishing proneness to aversive arousal, such approaches also
teach effective coping skills by demonstrating
proficient ways of handling threatening situations. The latter contribution is especially important when fear arousal partly results from
behavioral deficits. It is often the case that
fears and deficits are interdependent. Avoidance of stressful activities impedes development of coping skills, and the resulting lack
of competency provides a realistic basis for
fear. Acquiring behavioral means for controlling potential threats attenuates or eliminates fear arousal (Averill, 1973; Notterman, Schoenfeld, & Bersh, 1952; Szpiler &
Epstein, 1976). Behavioral control not only
allows one to manage the aversive aspects of
an environment. It also affects how the environment is likely to be perceived. Potentially stressful situations that can be controlled are construed as less threatening,
and such cognitive appraisals further reduce anticipatory emotional arousal (Averill,
1973).
Diminishing emotional arousal can reduce
avoidance behavior, but different theories
posit different explanatory mechanisms for
the observed effects. In the theory from
which the emotive treatments are derived,
emotional arousal is conceived of as a drive
that activates avoidance behavior. This view
stresses the energizing function of arousal

199

and the reinforcing function of arousal reduction. Social learning theory, on the other
hand, emphasizes the informative function
of physiological arousal. Simply acknowledging that arousal is both informative and motivating by no means resolves the issue in
dispute, because these are not necessarily two
separate effects that somehow jointly produce
behavior. Rather, the cognitive appraisal of
arousal to a large extent determines the level
and direction of motivational inducements
to action. Certain cognitive appraisals of
one's physiological state might be energizing,
whereas other appraisals of the same state
might not (Weiner, 1972). Moreover, many
forms of physiological arousal are generated
cognitively by arousing trains of thought.
When motivation is conceptualized in terms of
cognitive processes (Bandura, 1977; Weiner,
1972), the informational and motivational effects of arousal are treated as interdependent
rather than as separate events. We shall return to this issue later when we consider the
differential predictions made from social learning theory and from the dual-process theory of
avoidance behavior concerning the behavioral
effects of extinguishing anxiety arousal.
Researchers working within the attributional framework have attempted to modify
avoidance behavior by directly manipulating
the cognitive labeling of emotional arousal
(Valins & Nisbett, 1971). The presumption
is that if phobics are led to believe that the
things they have previously feared no longer
affect them internally, the cognitive reevaluation alone will reduce avoidance behavior. In
treatment analogues of this approach, phobics receive false physiological feedback suggesting that they are no longer emotionally
upset by threatening events. Results of this
procedure are essentially negative. Early
claims that erroneous arousal feedback reduces avoidance behavior (Valins & Ray,
1967) are disputed by methodologically
superior studies showing that false feedback
of physiological tranquility in the presence
of threats has either no appreciable effect
on subsequent fearful behavior (Gaupp,
Stern, & Galbraith, 1972; Hewlett & Nawas,
1971; Kent, Wilson, & Nelson, 1972; Rosen,
Rosen, & Reid, 1972; Sushinsky & Bootzin,

200

ALBERT BANDURA

1970), or produces minor changes under
such limited conditions as to be of little
practical consequence (Borkovec, 1973).
Misattribution of emotional arousal is
another variant of the attributional approach to modification of fearful behavior.
The strategy here is to lead fearful people
into believing that their emotional arousal
is caused by a nonemotional source. To the
extent that they no longer label their
agitated state as anxiety, they will behave
more boldly. It may be possible to reduce
mild fears by this means (Ross, Rodin, &
Zimbardo, 1969), but the highly anxious are
not easily led into misattributing their anxiety
to irrelevant sources (Nisbett & Schachter,
1966). When evaluated systematically, misattribution treatments do not produce significant changes in chronic anxiety conditions (Singerman, Borkovec, & Baron, 1976),
and some of the benefits reported with other
dysfunctions cannot be replicated (Bootzin,
Herman, & Nicassio, 1976; Kellogg & Baron,
197S). There is also some suggestive evidence
that in laboratory studies the attenuation of
fear may be due more to the veridicality of
arousal information than to misattribution of
fear arousal to an innocuous source (CalvertBoyanowsky & Leventhal, 1975).
Any reduction in fear resulting from deceptive feedback is apt to be short-lived
because illusory assurances are not an especially reliable way of creating durable selfexpectations. However, more veritable experiences that reduce the level of emotional
arousal can set in motion a reciprocal process
of change. In the social learning view, potential threats activate fear largely through
cognitive self-arousal (Bandura, 1969, 1977).
Perceived self-competence can therefore affect susceptibility to self-arousal. Individuals
who come to believe that they are less vulnerable than they previously assumed are less
prone to generate frightening thoughts in
threatening situations. Those whose fears
are relatively weak may reduce their selfdoubts and debilitating self-arousal to the
point where they perform successfully. Performance successes, in turn, strengthen selfefficacy. Such changes can, of course, be
reliably achieved without resort to ruses.

Moreover, mislabeling arousal or attributing
it to erroneous sources is unlikely to be of
much help to the highly anxious. Severe
acrophobics, for example, may be temporarily
misled into believing that they no longer
fear high elevations, but they will reexperience unnerving internal feedback when confronted with dreaded heights. It should also
be noted that in attributional explanations
of the success of behavioral treatments the
heavy emphasis on physiological arousal
derives more from speculations about the
nature of emotion (Schachter, 1964) than
from evidence that arousal is a major determinant of defensive behavior.
Cognitive Processing oj Efficacy

Information

The discussion thus far has centered primarily on the many sources of information—
enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive
—that people use to judge their level of
self-efficacy. At this point a distinction must
be drawn between information contained in
environmental events and information as
processed and transformed by the individual.
The impact of information on efficacy expectations will depend on how it is cognitively
appraised. A number of contextual factors,
including the social, situational, and temporal
circumstances under which events occur, enter
into such appraisals. For this reason, even
success experiences do not necessarily create
strong generalized expectations of personal
efficacy. Expectations that have served selfprotective functions for years are not quickly
discarded. When experience contradicts firmly
established expectations of self-efficacy, they
may undergo little change if the conditions
of performance are such as to lead one to
discount the import of the experience.
The corrective value of information derived
from successful performance can be attenuated in several ways. The first involves
discrimination processes. The consequences
individuals anticipate were they to perform
feared activities differ in circumstances which
vary in safeguards. As a result, they may
behave boldly in situations signifying safety,
but retain unchanged their self-doubts under
less secure conditions. Such mitigative discriminations can extend to the treatments

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

themselves, as well as to the situational circumstances in which behavioral attainments
occur. This is especially true of treatments
relying solely on symbolic and vicarious experience. Achieving reductions in fear to
threats presented symbolically is unlikely to
enhance perceived self-efficacy to any great
extent in people who believe that success in
imagery does not portend accomplishments
in reality. Information conveyed by facilely
modeled performances might likewise be
minimized by anxious observers on the
grounds that the models possess special
expertise enabling them to prevent injurious
consequences that might otherwise befall the
unskilled. Because such discriminations, even
though objectively mistaken, impede change
in self-efficacy, observers will be reluctant to
attempt feared activities and will be easily
dissuaded by negative experience.
Cognitive appraisals of the causes of one's
behavior, which have been examined extensively in investigations of self-attributional
processes (Bern, 1972), can similarly delimit
gains in self-efficacy from behavioral attainments. It was previously shown that attributions of affect and actions to illusory
competence have little, if any, effect on
refractory behavior. This does not, of course,
mean that causal appraisals are of limited
importance in the process of behavior change.
Quite the contrary, performance attainment
is a prominent source of efficacy information,
but it is by no means unambiguous. As already mentioned briefly, people can gain competence through authentic means but, because of faulty appraisals of the circumstances under which they improve, will credit
their achievements to external factors rather
than to their own capabilities. Here the
problem is one of inaccurate ascription of
personal competency to situational factors.
Successes are more likely to enhance selfefficacy if performances are perceived as
resulting from skill than from fortuitous or
special external aids. Conversely, failures
would be expected to produce greater reductions in self-efficacy when attributed to
ability rather than to unusual situational
circumstances. The more extensive the situational aids for performance, the greater are

201

the chances that behavior will be ascribed
to external factors (Bern, 1972; Weiner,
1972).
Even under conditions of perceived selfdetermination of outcomes, the impact of
performance attainments on self-efficacy will
vary depending on whether one's accomplishments are ascribed mainly to ability or to
effort. Success with minimal effort fosters
ability ascriptions that reinforce a strong
sense of self-efficacy. By contrast, analogous
successes achieved through high expenditure
of effort connote a lesser ability and are thus
likely to have a weaker effect on perceived
self-efficacy. Cognitive appraisals of the difficulty level of the tasks will further affect the
impact of performance accomplishments on
perceived self-efficacy. To succeed at easy
tasks provides no new information for altering one's sense of self-efficacy, whereas mastery of challenging tasks conveys salient evidence of enhanced competence. The rate and
pattern of attainments furnish additional information for judging personal efficacy. Thus,
people who experience setbacks but detect
relative progress will raise their perceived
efficacy more than those who succeed but see
their performances leveling off compared to
their prior rate of improvement.
Extrapolations from theories about attribution and self-perception to the field of behavioral change often imply that people must
labor unaided or under inconspicuously arranged influences if they are to convince
themselves of their personal competence
(Kopel & Arkowitz, 1975). Such prescriptions are open to question on both conceptual and empirical grounds. Cognitive
misappraisals that attenuate the impact of
disconfirming experiences can be minimized
without sacrificing the substantial benefits
of powerful induction procedures. This is
achieved by providing opportunities for selfdirected accomplishments after the desired
behavior has been established. Any lingering
doubts people might have, either about their
capabilities or about probable response consequences under unprotected conditions, are
dispelled easily in this manner (Bandura
et al., 197S). The more varied the circumstances in which threats are mastered in-

202

ALBERT BANDURA

dependently, the more likely are success experiences to authenticate personal efficacy
and to impede formation of discriminations
that insulate self-perceptions from disconfirming evidence.
Results of recent studies support the
thesis that generalized, lasting changes in
self-efficacy and behavior can best be
achieved by participant methods using powerful induction procedures initially to develop
capabilities, then removing external aids to
verify personal efficacy, then finally using
self-directed mastery to strengthen and generalize expectations of personal efficacy
(Bandura et al., 1975). Independent performance can enhance efficacy expectations
in several ways: (a) It creates additional
exposure to former threats, which provides
participants with further evidence that they
are no longer aversively aroused by what
they previously feared. Reduced emotional
arousal confirms increased coping capabilities,
(b) Self-directed mastery provides opportunities to perfect coping skills, which lessen
personal vulnerability to stress, (c) Independent performance, if well executed, produces
success experiences, which further reinforce
expectations of self-competency.
Extensive self-directed performance of
formerly threatening activities under progressively challenging conditions at a time
when treatments are usually terminated could
also serve to reduce susceptibility to relearning of defensive patterns of behavior. A few
negative encounters among many successful
experiences that have instilled a strong sense
of self-efficacy will, at most, establish discriminative avoidance of realistic threats, an
effect that has adaptive value. In contrast, if
people have limited contact with previously
feared objects after treatment, whatever
expectations of self-efficacy were instated
would be weaker and more vulnerable to
change. Consequently, a few unfavorable
experiences are likely to reestablish defensive
behavior that generalizes inappropriately.
We have already examined how cognitive
processing of information conveyed by modeling might influence the extent to which
vicarious experience effects changes in selfefficacy. Among the especially informative

elements are the models' characteristics (e.g.,
adeptness, perseverance, age, expertness), the
similarity between models and observers, the
difficulty of the performance tasks, the situational arrangements under which the modeled
achievements occur, and the diversity of
modeled attainments.
Just as the value of efficacy information
generated enactively and vicariously depends
on cognitive appraisal, so does the information arising from exhortative and emotive
sources. The impact of verbal persuasion on
self-efficacy may vary substantially depending on the perceived credibility of the persuaders, their prestige, trustworthiness, expertise, and assuredness. The more believable
the source of the information, the more
likely are efficacy expectations to change.
The influence of credibility on attitudinal
change has, of course, received intensive
study. But its effects on perceived self-efficacy
remain to be investigated.
People judge their physiological arousal
largely on the basis of their appraisal of the
instigating conditions. Thus, visceral arousal
occurring in situations perceived to be
threatening is interpreted as fear, arousal in
thwarting situations is experienced as anger,
and that resulting from irretrievable loss of
valued objects as sorrow (Hunt, Cole, &
Reis, 1958). Even the same source of physiological arousal may be interpreted differently
in ambiguous situations depending on the
emotional reactions of others in the same
setting (Mandler, 1975; Schachter & Singer,
1962).
When tasks are performed in ambiguous or
complex situations in which there is a variety
of evocative stimuli, the informational value
of the resultant arousal will depend on the
meaning imposed upon it. People who perceive their arousal as stemming from personal
inadequacies are more likely to lower their
efficacy expectations than those who attribute
their arousal to certain situational factors.
Given a proneness to ascribe arousal to personal deficiencies, the heightened attention to
internal events can result in reciprocally
escalating arousal. Indeed, as Sarason (1976)
has amply documented, individuals who are
especially susceptible to anxiety arousal

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

readily become self-preoccupied with their
perceived inadequacies in the face of difficulties rather than with the task at hand.
Differing Perspectives on

Self-efficacy

The phenomena encompassed by the construct of self-efficacy have been the subject
of interest in other theories of human behavior. The theoretical perspectives differ,
however, in how they view the nature and
origins of personal efficacy and the intervening processes by which perceived self-efficacy
affects behavior. In seeking a motivational
explanation of exploratory and manipulative
behavior, White (1959) postulated an "effectance motive," which is conceptualized as an
intrinsic drive for transactions with the environment. Unlike instigators arising from
tissue deficits, effectance motivation is believed to be aroused by novel stimulation
and is sustained when the resultant inquisitive and exploratory actions produce further
elements of novelty in the stimulus field.
The effectance motive presumably develops
through cumulative acquisition of knowledge
and skills in dealing with the environment.
However, the process by which an effectance
motive emerges from effective transactions
with the environment is not spelled out in
White's theory. Nor is the existence of the
motive easy to verify, because effectance
motivation is inferred from the exploratory
behavior it supposedly causes. Without an
independent measure of motive strength one
cannot tell whether people explore and manipulate things because of a competence motive
to do so, or for any number of other reasons.
Athough the theory of effectance motivation
has not been formulated in sufficient detail
to permit extensive theoretical comparisons,
there are several issues on which the social
learning and effectance theories clearly differ.
In the social learning analysis, choice behavior and effort expenditure are governed
in part by percepts of self-efficacy rather
than by a drive condition. Because efficacy
expectations are defined and measured independently of performance, they provide
an explicit basis for predicting the occurrence,
generality, and persistence of coping be-

203

havior, whereas an omnibus motive does
not. People will approach, explore, and try
to deal with situations within their selfperceived capabilities, but they will avoid
transactions with stressful aspects of their
environment they perceive as exceeding their
ability.
The alternative views also differ on the
origins of efficacy. Within the framework of
effectance theory, the effectance drive develops gradually through prolonged transactions with one's surroundings. This theory
thus focuses almost exclusively on the effects
produced by one's own actions. In the social
learning theory, self-efficacy is conceptualized
as arising from diverse sources of information conveyed by direct and mediated experience. These differences in theoretical approach have significant implications for how
one goes about studying the role of perceived
self-efficacy in motivational and behavioral
processes. Expectations of personal efficacy
do not operate as dispositional determinants
independently of contextual factors. Some
situations require greater skill and more
arduous performances and carry higher risk
of negative consequences than do others.
Expectations will vary accordingly. Thus, for
example, the level and strength of perceived
self-efficacy in public speaking will differ
depending on the subject matter, the format
of the presentation, and the types of audiences that will be addressed. The social
learning approach is therefore based on a
microanalysis of perceived coping capabilities
rather than on global personality traits or
motives of effectance. From this perspective,
it is no more informative to speak of selfefficacy in general terms than to speak of
nonspecific approach behavior. To elucidate
how perceived self-efficacy affects behavior
requires a microanalysis of both factors.
Discrepancies between efficacy expectations and performance are most likely to
arise under conditions in which situational
and task factors are ambiguous. When performance requirements are ill-defined, people
who underestimate the situational demands
will display positive discrepancies between
self-efficacy and performance attainments;
those who overestimate the demands will

Microanalysis of Self-efficacy
Change

and Behavioral

To test derivations from the social learning analysis of the process of change, an
experiment was conducted wherein severe
phobics received treatments designed to
create differential levels of efficacy expectations, and then the relationship between selfefficacy and behavioral change was analyzed
in detail (Bandura et al., in press). The experiment proceeded as follows. Adult snake
phobics, whose phobias affected their lives adversely, were administered for equivalent
periods either participant modeling, modeling alone, or no treatment. In participant
modeling, which operates through direct
mastery experiences, subjects were assisted,
by whatever induction aids were needed, to
engage in progressively more threatening interactions with a boa constrictor. After completing all the therapeutic tasks, which included holding the snake, placing open hands
in front of its head as it moved about the
room, holding the snake in front of their
faces, and allowing it to crawl freely in their
laps, the subjects engaged in a brief period
of self-directed mastery. In the present experiment, the modeling aid was used only
briefly if needed to help initiate performance
in order to minimize overlap of this element
in the two modes of treatment.
Subjects receiving the modeling treatment
merely observed the therapist perform the
same activities for an equivalent period.
These subjects did not engage in any behavior
themselves, and consequently they had no

205

performance sources of information for their
efficacy expectations. Enactive and vicarious
procedures were selected for study to assess
the predictive value of self-efficacy created
by quite different modes of treatment.
The level, strength, and generality of the
subjects' efficacy expectations were measured
at critical junctures in the change process.
Subjects privately designated, on a list of 18
performance tasks ranked in order of increasing threat, those tasks they considered
themselves capable of executing. They then
rated the strength of their expectations for
each of these tasks on a 100-point probability
scale ranging, in 10-unit intervals, from great
uncertainty, through intermediate values of
certainty, to complete certainty. They rated
their efficacy expectations for coping with
snakes of the same variety used in treatment
as well as dissimilar snakes to measure the
generality of their efficacy expectations.
These measures were obtained prior to treatment, following treatment but before the
behavioral posttest, and after completing the
posttest. Approach behavior was assessed in
the posttest by a series of performance tasks
requiring increasingly more threatening interactions with a different type of boa constrictor
from the one used in treatment and with a
corn snake of markedly different appearance
but equivalent threat value. Different phobic
objects were used to provide a test of the
generalized effects of changes in efficacy
expectations along a dimension of similarity
to the threat used in treatment.
Subjects assigned to the control condition
participated in the assessment procedures
without receiving any intervening treatment.
Following completion of the posttest, the
controls and those in the modeling condition
who failed to achieve terminal performances
received the participant modeling treatment.
Consistent with the social learning analysis
of the sources of self-efficacy, experiences
based on performance accomplishments produced higher, more generalized, and stronger
efficacy expectations than did vicarious experience, which in turn exceeded those in
the control condition. Figure 3 summarizes
the level of efficacy expectations and performance as a function of treatment condi-

tions at different phases of the experiment.
As shown in the figure, performance change
corresponds closely to the magnitude of expectancy change. The greater the increments
in self-perceived efficacy, the greater the
changes in behavior. Similar relationships between level of self-efficacy and performance
are obtained when the data are considered
separately for the two snakes. In accordance
with prediction, participant modeling produced the more generalized increases in efficacy expectations and the more generalized
behavioral changes.
Although the enactive and vicarious treatments differed in their power to enhance
self-efficacy, the efficacy expectations were
equally predictive of subsequent performance
irrespective of how they were instated. The
higher the level of perceived self-efficacy at
the completion of treatment the higher was
the level of approach behavior for efficacy
expectations instated enactively (r = .83) and
vicariously (r = .84). It might be noted here
that all subjects had at their disposal the
component responses for producing the interactive patterns of behavior, and they all had
some incentive to overcome their phobic behavior. Under conditions in which people
differ substantially in component capabilities
and motivation, skill and incentive factors

will also contribute to variance in performance.
Correlation coefficients based on aggregate
measures do not fully reveal the degree of
correspondence between self-efficacy and performance on the specific behavioral tasks
from which the aggregate scores are obtained.
A subject can display an equivalent number
of efficacy expectations and successful performances, but they might not correspond
entirely to the same tasks. The most precise
index of the relationship is provided by a
microanalysis of the congruence between selfefficacy and performance at the level of individual tasks. This measure was obtained by
recording whether or not subjects considered
themselves capable of performing each of
the various tasks at the end of treatment
and by computing the percentage of accurate
correspondence between efficacy judgment
and actual performance. Self-efficacy was a
uniformly accurate predictor of performance
on tasks varying in difficulty with different
threats regardless of whether the changes in
self-efficacy were produced through performance accomplishments (89% congruence) or
by vicarious experience alone (86% congruence). The degree of congruence between
perceived self-efficacy and subsequent behavior is equally high for enactive (82%) and

SELF-EFFICACY

vicarious (79%) treatments when the microanalysis is conducted only on the subset of
tasks that subjects had never performed in the
pretest assessment.
In the preceding analysis efficacy expectations were considered without regard to
strength. A weak sense of self-efficacy thus
received the same weight as one reflecting
complete certitude. However, the intensity
and persistence of effort, and hence level of
performance, should be higher with strong
than with weak self-efficacy. The likelihood
that a task will be performed as a function
of the strength of the corresponding efficacy
expectation therefore provides a further refinement in the analysis of the relationship
between self-efficacy and performance. The
probability of successful performance of any
given task as a function of strength of efficacy
expectations is plotted in Figure 4. Because
the control subjects performed few responses
and had correspondingly restricted efficacy
expectations, their data were plotted after
they had received the participant modeling
treatment. In all conditions, the stronger the
efficacy expectations, the higher was the
likelihood that a particular task would be
successfully completed. The positive relationship between strength of self-efficacy and
probability of successful performance is virtually identical for the similar and the dissimilar threats.
In brief, the theory systematizes a variety
of findings. As the preceding results show, it

predicts accurately the magnitude and generality of behavioral change for efficacy expectations induced enactively and vicariously.
Moreover, it orders variations in level of
behavioral change occurring within the same
treatment condition. Subjects who received
participant modeling, either as the primary
or as the supplementary treatment, successfully performed all of the behaviors in treatment that were later assessed in the posttest
toward different threats. Although all had
previously achieved maximal performances,
not all expressed maximal efficacy expectations. One can therefore compare the error
rates of predictions made from maximal past
performance and from maximal efficacy expectations. It would be predicted from the
proposed theory that among these successful
performers, those who acquire maximal efficacy expectations should attain terminal performances, whereas those holding lower expectations should not. If one predicts that
those who performed maximally in treatment
will likewise achieve terminal performances
when assessed with similar tasks, the error
rate is relatively low for the similar threat
(28%) but high for the dissimilar threat
(52%). If, on the other hand, one predicts
that those who express maximal expectations
will perform maximally, the error rate is
comparably low for both the similar (21%)
and the dissimilar (24%) threats. The predictive superiority of efficacy expectations
over past performance is significant for total

approach behavior and for approach behavior
toward the dissimilar threat. These differential findings indicate that experienced
mastery altered subjects' sense of personal
efficacy rather than merely providing behavioral cues for judgments of self-efficacy.
The theory also accounts for variations in
behavioral change produced by modeling
alone. To equate for duration of treatment,
subjects in the modeling condition were
yoked to matched counterparts in participant
modeling, who received treatment until they
performed all the therapeutic tasks. The
subjects in the participant modeling condition varied in the time they required to complete treatment, so some of the subjects in
the modeling conditions had only brief exposure to successful performances, whereas
others had the benefit of observing feared
activities modeled repeatedly without any
untoward consequences. The findings are
consistent with hypothesized increases in selfefficacy as a function of repeated observation of successful modeling. Brief exposure
produced limited increases in the level (9%)
and strength (5%) of efficacy expectations
and correspondingly little behavior change
(10%). In contrast, repeated observation of
successful performances increased by a substantial amount the level (44%) and strength
(38%) of self-efficacy which, in turn, was
accompanied by similarly large increments
in performance (35%).
Comparison of Self-efficacy
Theory

and Dual-Process

As a further test of the generality of the
theory under discussion, a microanalysis was
conducted of efficacy expectations instated
by desensitization procedures, which are
aimed at reducing emotional arousal. Social
learning theory and the dual-process theory
of anxiety, on which the desensitization approach is based, posit different explanatory
mechanisms for the changes accompanying
this mode of treatment. The alternative views
therefore give rise to differential predictions
that can be readily tested.
The standard desensitization approach is

based on the assumption that anxiety activates defensive behavior (Wolpe, 1974).
According to this view, association of neutral
events with aversive stimulation creates an
anxiety drive that motivates defensive behavior; the defensive behavior, in turn, is
reinforced by reducing the anxiety aroused
by conditioned aversive stimuli. Hence, to
eliminate defensive responding, it is considered necessary to eradicate its underlying
anxiety. Treatment strategies are therefore
keyed to reduction of emotional arousal.
Aversive stimuli are presented at graduated
levels in conjunction with relaxation until
anxiety reactions to the threats are eliminated.
Although desensitization produces behavioral changes, there is little evidence to
support the original rationale that defensive
behavior is diminished because anxiety is
eliminated either by reciprocal physiological
inhibition or by associative recoupling of
threatening stimuli to relaxation. Desensitization does not require graduated exposure, and
anxiety-reducing activities are at most facilitory, not necessary, conditions for eliminating
defensive behavior (Bandura, 1969; Wilson
& Davison, 1971).
The principal assumption that defensive
behavior is controlled by anxiety arousal is
also disputed by several lines of evidence.
Autonomic arousal, which constitutes the
principal index of anxiety,-is not necessary
for defensive learning. Because autonomic reactions take much longer to activate than do
avoidance responses, the latter cannot be
caused by the former. Studies in which autonomic and avoidance responses are measured
concurrently indicate that these two modes
of activity may be partially correlated in the
acquisition phase but are not causally related (Black, 1965). Avoidance behavior, for
example, can persist long after autonomic
reactions to threats have been extinguished.
Surgical removal of autonomic feedback capability in animals has little effect on the
acquisition of avoidance responses (Rescorla
& Solomon, 1967). Maintenance of avoidance
behavior is even less dependent on autonomic
feedback. Once defensive behavior has been
learned, depriving animals of autonomic feed-

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

back does not hasten the rate at which such
activities are extinguished.
Research casts doubt on the postulated
reinforcement sources, as well as the activating sources, of defensive behavior. In the
dual-process theory, the anxiety reduction
occasioned by escape from the feared stimulus presumably reinforces the defensive behavior. The evidence, however, reveals that
whether or not defensive behavior removes
the feared stimulus has variable effects on
the maintenance of the behavior (Bolles,
1972a). Moreover, defensive behavior can be
acquired and maintained by its success in
diminishing the frequency of aversive stimulation, even though there are no feared
stimuli to arouse anxiety and to provide the
source of decremental reinforcement (Herrnstein, 1969). The substantial negative evidence concerning an anxiety mediational
mechanism in avoidance behavior suggests
that the effects of desensitization treatment
must result from some other mechanism of
operation.
Social learning theory regards anxiety and
defensive behavior as coeffects rather than as
causally linked (Bandura, 1977). Aversive
experiences, either of a personal or vicarious
sort, create expectations of injurious effects
that can activate both fear and defensive behavior. Being coeffects, there is no fixed
relationship between autonomic arousal and
actions. Until effective coping behaviors are
achieved, perceived threats produce high
emotional arousal and various defensive
maneuvers. But after people become adept at
self-protective behaviors, they perform them
in potentially threatening situations without
having to be frightened (Notterman et al.,
1952). Should their habitual coping devices
fail, they experience heightened arousal until
new defensive learning reduces their vulnerability.
Perceived threats activate defensive behavior because of their predictive value rather
than their aversive quality. That is, when
formerly neutral stimuli are associated with
painful experiences, it is not that the stimuli
have become aversive but that individuals
have learned to anticipate aversive consequences. It is people's knowledge of their

209

environment, not the stimuli, that are
changed by correlated experience. Stimuli
having predictive significance signal the
likelihood of painful consequences unless
protective measures are taken. Defensive behavior, in turn, is maintained by its success
in forestalling or reducing the occurrence of
aversive events. Once established, self-protective behavior is difficult to eliminate even
though the hazards no longer exist. This is
because consistent avoidance prevents a person from learning that the real-life conditions
have changed. Hence, the nonoccurrence of
anticipated hazards reinforces the expectation
that the defensive maneuvers forestalled
them.
From the perspective of dual-process
theory, thorough extinction of anxiety should
eliminate avoidance behavior. In the desensitization treatment, however, anxiety reactions
are typically extinguished to visualized representations of feared situations. One would
expect some transfer loss of extinction effects
from symbolic to real-life threats, as is indeed the case (Agras, 1967; Barlow et al.,
1969). It is not uncommon for people to
fear and avoid real-life situations to which
they have been desensitized in imagery.
Therefore, according to this view, thorough
extinction of anxiety to visualized threats
should produce substantial, though less than
complete, reductions in defensive behavior.
However, dual-process theory provides no
basis for predicting either the level of behavior change or the variability in behavior
displayed by subjects who have all been
equally desensitized.
In the social learning analysis presented
earlier, reducing physiological arousal improves performance by raising efficacy expectations rather than by eliminating a drive
that instigates the defensive behavior. This
information-based view of the mediating
mechanism predicts that the higher and
stronger the efficacy expectations instated by
desensitization procedures, the greater are
the reductions in defensive behavior. Because
arousal is only one of several sources of
efficacy information, and not necessarily the
most dependable one, extinguishing anxiety

arousal is rarely a sufficient condition for
eliminating defensive behavior.
To test the theory that desensitization
changes behavior through its intervening
effects on efficacy expectations, severe snake
phobics were administered the standard
desensitization treatment until their emotional reactions were completely extinguished
to imaginal representations of the most
aversive scenes (Bandura & Adams, in press).
The assessment procedures were identical to
those used in the preceding experiment. Subjects' approach behavior was tested on the
series of performance tasks before and after
the desensitization treatment. The level,
strength, and generality of their efficacy
expectations were similarly measured before
treatment, upon completion of treatment but
prior to the posttest, and following the posttest.
The findings show that phobics whose
anxiety reactions to visualized threats have
been thoroughly extinguished emerge from
the desensitization treatment with widely
differing efficacy expectations. As depicted
graphically in Figure 5, performance corresponds closely to level of self-efficacy. The
higher the subjects' level of perceived self-

efficacy at the end of treatment, the more
approach behavior they subsequently performed in the posttest assessment (r — .74).
Results of the microanalysis of congruence
between self-efficacy at the end of treatment
and performance on each of the tasks administered in the posttest are consistent with
the findings obtained from enactive and vicarious treatment. Self-efficacy was an accurate predictor of subsequent performance
on 85% for all the tasks, and 83% for the
subset of tasks that subjects were unable to
perform in the pretest assessment. Subjects
successfully executed tasks within the range
of their perceived self-efficacy produced by
the desensitization treatment, whereas they
failed at tasks they perceived to be beyond
their capabilities.
Microanalysis oj Self-efficacy and
Performance During the Process of Change
The preceding series of experiments examined the predictive value of self-efficacy at
the completion of different modes of treatment. A further study investigated the process
of efficacy and behavioral change during the
course of treatment itself. Participant model-

SELF-EFFICACY THEORY

ing was selected for this purpose because the
amount of treatment can be well-regulated
and it promotes rapid change.
As in the previous studies, adults whose
lives were adversely affected by severe snake
phobias were tested for their efficacy expectations and approach behavior using the microanalytic methodology described earlier. The
various treatment activities were segmented
into natural blocks of tasks of increasing
difficulty and threat value. Items in the initial
block included looking at a snake from
progressively closer distances; intermediate
blocks required subjects to touch and to hold
the snake with gloved and bare hands for
increasing intervals; the terminal block required them to tolerate the snake crawling
about freely in their laps for an extended
period. Subjects received the participant
modeling treatment only for the block of
items they failed in the hierarchy of assessment tasks. Treatment was continued until
they could perform the activities in the
failed block, whereupon they were tested for
their efficacy expectations and approach responses on the succeeding tasks. Subjects
who attained terminal performances received
no further treatment. For those who achieved
only partial improvement, the sequence of
treatment on the failed block followed by
assessments of self-efficacy and approach behavior on succeeding blocks was repeated until
they achieved terminal performances.
Findings of the microanalysis lend further
support to the postulated cognitive mechanism of change. Subjects who mastered the
same intermediate performances during the
course of treatment varied considerably in
their behavioral attainments when tested on
succeeding blocks of tasks. Past performance
was therefore of limited value in predicting
what subjects would be able to do when confronted with more threatening tasks. However,
efficacy judgments proved to be good predictors of degree of behavioral change resulting
from partial mastery experiences. Self-efficacy
predicted subsequent performance as measured at different points in treatment in 92%
of the total assessment tasks. This relationship
holds even when the measure of congruence is
based only on the subset of activities that

211

subjects could not perform in pretest because
they found them too threatening, and did not
perform in treatment because the activities
extended beyond the failed block. Expectations of personal effectiveness formed through
partial mastery experiences during the course
of treatment predicted, at a 84% level of
accuracy, performance on highly threatening
tasks that subjects had never done before.
Concluding Remarks
The present theoretical formulation orders
variations in the level of behavioral changes
produced by different modes of treatment; it
accounts for behavioral variations displayed
by individuals receiving the same type of
treatment; and it predicts performance successes at the level of individual tasks during
and after treatment. It is possible to generate
alternative explanations for particular subsets of data, but the mechanism proposed in
the present theory appears to account equally
well for the different sets of findings. It might
be argued, for example, that self-efficacy
proved to be an accurate predictor of performance in the enactive mode of treatment
because subjects were simply judging their
future performance from their past behavior.
However, an interpretation of this type has
no explanatory value for the vicarious and
emotive treatments, in which perceived selfefficacy was an equally accurate predictor of
performance although subjects engaged in no
overt behavior. Even in the enactive treatment, perceived self-efficacy proved to be a
better predictor of behavior toward unfamiliar
threats than did past performance. Moreover, self-efficacy derived from partial enactive mastery during the course of treatment
predicted performance on stressful tasks that
the individuals had never done before.
As an alternative explanation, one could
invoke a superordinate mediator that controls both efficacy expectations and behavior.
Although such a possibility is not inconceivable, the mediator would have to be an exceedingly complex one to account adequately
for the diverse sets of relationships. To cite
but a few examples, it would have to affect
differentially efficacy expectations and be-

212

havior resulting from maximal enactive mastery; somehow, it would have to produce
different levels of self-efficacy from equivalent reductions in emotional arousal; and it
would have to generate some variation in
efficacy expectations from similar partial
mastery experiences. The theory presented
here posits a central processor of efficacy
information. That is, people process, weigh,
and integrate diverse sources of information
concerning their capability, and they regulate
their choice behavior and effort expenditure
accordingly.
Evidence that people develop somewhat
different efficacy expectations from similar
enactive mastery and fear extinction warrants
comment. One possible explanation for the
variance is in terms of differential cognitive
processing of efficacy information. To the extent that individuals differ in how they cognitively appraise their arousal decrements and
behavioral attainments, their percepts of
self-efficacy will vary to some degree. A second possibility concerns the multiple determination of self-efficacy. Because people have
met with different types and amounts of
efficacy-altering experiences, providing one
new source of efficacy information would not
be expected to affect everyone uniformly.
Thus, for example, extinguishing arousal to
threats will enhance self-efficacy, but more
so in individuals whose past coping attempts
have occasionally succeeded than in those who
have consistently failed.
The research completed thus far has tested
the predictive power of the conceptual scheme
for efficacy expectations developed through
enactive, vicarious, and emotive-based procedures. Additional tests of the generality of
this approach need to be extended to efficacy
expectations arising from verbal persuasion
and from other types of treatments aimed at
reducing emotional arousal.
Cognitive processing of efficacy information, which is an important component function in the proposed theory, is an especially
relevant area for research. A number of factors were identified as influencing the cognitive appraisal of efficacy information conveyed by each of the major sources of selfefficacy. Previous research from a number

of different perspectives demonstrating that
some of these factors affect attitudinal and
behavioral changes has suggestive value. But
it is investigations that include assessment of
the intervening self-efficacy link that can best
provide validity for the present theory.
The operative process involved in the relationship between efficacy expectations and
action also requires further investigation. It
will be recalled that efficacy expectations are
presumed to influence level of performance
by enhancing intensity and persistence of
effort. In the preceding experiments, the
behavioral tasks were ordered in level of
difficulty and subjects either persisted in
their efforts until they completed all of the
tasks or they quit at varying points along
the way. The number of tasks successfully
completed reflects degree of perseverance. As
a further step toward elucidating the intervening process, it would be of interest to
measure the intensity and duration of effort
subjects exert in attempts to master arduous
or insoluble tasks as a function of the level
and strength of their efficacy expectations.
Further research on the processes postulated
in the present theoretical formulation should
increase our understanding of the relationship between cognitive and behavioral change.
