REVISED SCALE FOR AMBIGUITY TOLERANCE:
RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY
A. P. MAC DONALD, JR.
Rehabilitation Research G. Training Center, West Virginia Universiby
Summary.-Increasing the 16-item Rydell-Rosen Ambiguity Tolerance Scale
to 20 items raised the reliability from .64 to .86 (split-half, corrected by Spearman-Brown). The 20-item scale (AT-20) was cross-validated on a sample of
789 undergraduate students. Retest reliability was estimated at .63 ( p
.01)
for a 6-mo. interval. As predicted, AT-20 related to (a) performance in a complex task, ( b ) the F Scale, (c) dogmatism, ( d ) rigidity, and ( e ) church attendance. The AT-20 was not affected by social desirability response bias as measured by the Marlowe-Crowne.

<

Interest in the concept of tolerance of ambiguity derives chiefly from the
work of Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, and Sanford ( 1950). FrenkelBrunswik contributed the greater part of this research, which attempted to relate
intolerance of ambiguity to the authoritarian syndrome ( 1949, 195 1 ) . Similar
efforts were made by Rokeach ( 1948) who later developed the related concept
of dogmatism ( 1960).
Apart from the interest in the relationship between ambiguity tolerance and
authoritarianism and ethnocentrism, there has been some interest in the variable
of ambiguity tolerance in its own right. It is to that more general interest that
this paper is addressed.
Intolerance of ambiguity may be viewed as a general tendency to perceive
ambiguous material or situarions as threatening (Budner, 1962). Conversely,
tolerance of ambiguicy implies that contact with ambiguity is desirable. Though
definitions overlap considerably, no common definition has been accepted. For
example, English and English (1958) define ambiguity tolerance as a ". . . willingness to accept a state of affairs capable of alternate interpretations, or of
alternate outcomes: e.g., feeling comfortable (or at least not feeling uncomfortable) when faced by a complex social issue in which opposed principles ate
intermingled. Low ambiguity tolerance is shown by the desire to have everything reduced to black and white . . ." (p. 24).
It is the impression of the author that persons having high tolerance of
ambiguity ( a ) seek out ambiguity, ( b ) enjoy ambiguity, and ( c ) excel in the
performance of ambiguous tasks. "An ambiguous situation may be defined as
one which cannot be adequately suucnued or categorized by the individual because of lack of sufficient cues" (Budner, 1962, p. 30).
Historically, the concepts of "intolerance of ambiguity" and "rigidity" have
been somewhat confounded. Frenkel-Brunswik used the term "rigidity" to refer
to intolerance of ambiguity and also to refer to resistance to change (1951).
The author, among others (e.g., Brown, 1965; Budner, 1962), maintains that,
although related, the two concepts are theoretically and empirically separate.

Whereas ambiguity tolerance implies tendencies to relate to and interact in differing ways with certain classes of phenomena, rigidity refers to a more generally
pervasive singular response mode. A rigid person may be viewed as one who
perseverates in a given response (despite empirical evidence to the contrary)
whereas an intolerant person may be more likely to replace one response with
another. For example, a rigid person and an intolerant person may be equally
anxious for closure, and therefore each may seize upon immediately available
answers to various questions. Once having accepted an answer, the former will
tenaciously (i.e., rigidly) hold on to it, even in the face of new contradictory
evidence. The latter, on the other hand, may easily exchange the held belief for
a better one. Consequently, one may be intolerant of ambiguity and yet be flexible, though the two characteristics are often found together. Empirical support
for the notion that rigidity and ambiguity tolerance are separate is offered by
Eysenck who reports over-all low correlations between measures of intolerance
of ambiguity and perceptual and conceptual rigidity (Eysenck, 1954).
The confusion concerning the definitions of the terms "rigidity" and "intolerance of ambiguity" has been paralleled by confusion in the measurement of
these concepts. For example, Frenkel-Brunswik (1949) tested for intolerance
of ambiguity by measuring the extent to which Ss maintained an original response (i.e., a "set") despite empirical evidence to the contrary (which is the
definition of rigidity offered above). A picture of a dog was shown and then
followed by a number of pictures representing a gradual ttansformation of the
dog into a cat. Those who held on to the original interpretation (i.e., dog) for
the longest time were considered to have lower tolerance for ambiguity.
Recently, attempts have been made to develop paper-and-pencil tests of
ambiguity tolerance. By and large, such efforts have not shown a great deal of
promise. For example, Ehrlich (1965) discredited Walk's A Scale when she
reported that the scale had virtually no internal consistency (i.e., a Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 of .08) and that one-third of the items correlated negatively
in an inter-item correlational matrix. The remaining correlations were consistently low and predominantly nonsignificant. Another example of the lack of
internal consistency found in such scales is reported by Child (1965). Child
reports an s of .16 (alpha coefficient) for his tolerance of ambiguity scale.
O n the more positive side, the Budner Scale of Tolerance-Intolerance of
Ambiguity has shown fairly good internal consistency (Budner, 1962). Reliabilities (alpha coefficients) reported for 13 of his 17 samples ranged from .39
to .62, with a mean of approximately .49. However, the reported association
between the Budner and Walk scales (i.e., r = .54, p < .05; Budner, 1962) is
difficult to evaluate in light of Ehrlich's criticism of Walk's A Scale, presented
above.
Recently another measure of ambiguity tolerance was introduced into the
research literature (Rydell 8: Rosen, 1966). It consists of 16 true-false items.

SCALE: TOLERANCE OF AhfBIGUITY

NO internal consistency coefficients are reported for this scale; however, stability
escimates based upon retest intervals of 1 and 2 mo. are .71 and .57 respectively.
Each estimate attained significance beyond the .001 level of confidence. Additionally, Rydell (1966) reports information regarding the validity of the
scale. Ss of high and low tolerance differed significantly on mean semantic
differential ratings of contradictory and noncontradictory adjective-noun concept-combinations. The following is a report of a series of studies done in order
to furnish additional data on the properties of this inscrumenc and a minor revision thereof.

17 and 18, Table I ) , and two items (15 and 18) from Barron's (1953) conformity scale (Items 19 and 20, Table 1 ) . Item analysis of the Rydell-Rosen
test showed that all items correlated well with the total test score. Table 2 shows
that the biserial correlations ranged from .21 to .70. The coefficient of internal
consistency (split-half corrected by Spearman-Brown) was computed as .64.

In an effort to increase the reliability of the test, the two CPI and two Barron conformity items were added to the scores based upon the 16-item test, thus
producing a 20-item test. Table 2 shows that the correlations of these items
with the total score ranged from .36 to .73. The internal consistency estimate
for the 20-item test was computed at .86, which represented a sizable increase
above the .64 obtained for the 16-item test. Reliability for the 20-item scale
was also computed using the more conservative estimate provided by the KuderRichardson Formula 20. The K-R 20 yielded an 7 of .73.
The 20-item ambiguity tolerance test (AT-20) was subsequently administered (primarily for cross-validational purposes) to 789 undergraduate students
(in class) at Ithaca College. An r of .63 (K-R 20) was obtained on this group.
The mean and standard deviation for the total group were 10.51 and 3.32
(males: 10.04, 3.38,
= 341, and females: 10.87, 3.23, N = 448).
To obtain a stability estimate, the AT-20 was administered to 24 male un-

between administrations was .63 ( p < .01) . The stability coefficient exceeded
those obtained on the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (Form E ) (.45, p < .05) and
the Gough-Sanford Rigidity Scale (.57,p < .Ol), which were also administered.

The hypothesis that ambiguity tolerance would be associated with level of
performance in ambiguous tasks was tested on 50 (19 males and 31 females)
advanced placement high school students at Cornell Universi7.l Within a
larger package of materials, Ss were administered the AT-20 and an anagram
test (developed by the author). The Scrambled Words Test consists of a list
of 20 common words whose letters have been scrambled. The words range from
three to seven letters in length. Ss were assigned the task of unscrambling as
many words as possible within a 3-min. time period. A significant correlation
( I = -33, p < .01) was obtained between the scores on the AT-20 and the
scores on the Scrambled Words Test.
In an effort to establish construct validity, the AT-20 was administered,
along with measures of related concepts, to 789 (341 males and 448 females)
undergraduates at Ithaca College. The forms were administered in class."igidity (Gough-Sanford Rigidity Scale; Rokeach, 1960, p. 418) and Dogmatism
(Form E; Rokeach, 1960) were measured along with ambiguity tolerance. T o
provide information on the extent to which these measures might be affected by
social desirability response tendencies, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability
Scale (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960) was also administered to a sub-sample of 341
students (121 males and 220 females). In addition to these tests, information
concerning frequency of church attendance was collected. Ss were asked to indicate how often they attended church services. Responses were placed upon a
six-point scale (i.e., "once a week" through "rarely or never") with high scores
being associated with frequent attendance. It was hypothesized that frequent
church attendance would be associated with intolerance of ambiguity, dogmatism,
and rigidity.
Data reported in Table 3 indicate that the AT-20, Rokeach Dogmatism
Scale, and the Gough-Sanford Rigidity Scale are tapping a common dimension.
AT-20 accounts for approximately 18% of the variance in the Dogmatism scores
and about 17% of the variance in the Rigidity scores.
The hypothesized relationship between ambiguity tolerance, rigidity, and
dogmatism was supported by the data. Significant correlations obtained among
all measures. It is of some interest that the correlations between church attend'The author would like to express his appreciation to Steve Berg for his assistance throughout all phases of this study.

ance and AT-20 and the Gough-Sanford are approximately twice as large as that
obtained between Dogm;ltism and church attendance. Also, the correlation between dogmatism and church attendance was significant for females but not for
males.
Additional evidence of the relational fertility of the AT-20 was obtained
from a sample of 90 male physical education majors at Ithaca College. A correlation of -30 ( p < .01) was found between Ss' scores on the 29-item F scale

Inspection of the data presented in Table 3 shows that the AT-20 is free

whereas small but significant correlations were found between the MarloweCrowne and the measures of dogmatism ( r = -.23, p < .01) and rigidity ( r
= .18, p < .01) . Incidentally, Becker and Dileo ( 1967) hypothesized that the
Dogmatism and Marlowe-Crowne Scales would be correlated. Their hypothesis
was not supported in their sn~dyof 216 undergraduate students. These data indicate that a small, but negative, correlation obtains between the two variables.

DISCUSSION
This series of studies undertaken to investigate the properties of the RydellRosen 16-item Ambiguity Tolerance Scale has led to revision of char scale. The
inclusion of four add~tlonalitems raised the split-half reliability coefficient from
.64 to .86 (or .73, by K-R 20). Cross-validation of the 20-item scale (AT-20)
yielded an r of .63 (by K-R 20) on a sample of 789 undergraduate students.
Compared wich other tests of ambiguity tolerance, this scale has shown reasonably good internal consistency.
The AT-20 demonstrated rather high retest reliability for a test interval of
6 mo. The stability coefficient of .63, obtained with a sample of 24 male physlcal education majors, is consistent wich the .71 and .57 (1- and 2-mo. intervals,
respectively) reported by Rydell and Rosen (1966) for their 16-item scale.
The possible contribution of the artifact of social desirability response
tendency was explored by computing the correlation between the AT-20 and the
Marlowe-Crowne SDS. The obtained coefficient of .02 indicates that the AT-20
is free of such response bias. The corresponding issue of response set was not
explored and perhaps should be, in light of the fact that the numbers of items
scored true and false are not balanced.
Evidence for construct validity is indicated by the support obtained for the
hypotheses that ( a ) ambiguiry tolerance is related to performance of ambiguous
tasks (i.e., people with high tolerance tend to excel in such tasks) and ( b ) that
intolerance of ambiguity is associated with frequent church attendance. Additional validational evidence was reflected in the significant correlations between
the AT-20 and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (Form E ) , the Gough-Sanford
Rigidity Scale, and the F Scale.
In view of the obtained findings it is concluded that the AT-20 shows
promise of being a useful instrument for the measurement and further investigation of ambiguity tolerance.
